The Open For Business Project is an open source project that provides tools
for businesses based on Sun's J2EE standard.  The project is intended to be open
and used by a large group of people.  Because of that it is licensed using the
<a href="ofbizmitlicense.html">MIT Open Source License.</a>
<p>The over-arching vision of the Open For Business Project is to embrace and
enable <font size="4">The 5 E's</font>:&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li>Ease of Cost</li>
  <li>Ease of Installation</li>
  <li>Ease of Customization</li>
  <li>Ease of Integration</li>
  <li>Ease of Use.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tools and components available can shorten J2EE business project cycles by months through a well designed architecture, pre-built components, and
a dynamic entity model based data source abstraction layer. The goal of the Open
For Business project is to provide useful, standards compliant tools and
applications.&nbsp;<p>These standards will include: <a href="http://www.w3c.org">XML</a>;
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee">J2EE</a>; <a href="http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/ruleml/">RuleML</a>;
<a href="http://www.wfmc.org/standards/docs.htm">WfMC</a>;
<a href="http://www.bpmi.org">BPML</a>; <a href="http://www.ebxml.org">ebXML</a>;
GAAP &amp; <a href="http://www.fasb.org/">FASB</a>; OMG's <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/omg_business_specs.htm">Workflow</a>,
<a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/omg_finance_specs.htm">GL,
Party</a>, <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/omg_mfg_specs.htm">Product</a>,
etc; <a href="http://www.arapxml.net/">ArapXML</a>; and other leading standards
that relate to the various tools, components and applications of Open For
Business.
<p>To help us provide a strong data model foundation for the project we are
using entity designs from various standards bodies, and the The Data Model
Resource Book, Revised Edition, Volumes 1 &amp; 2 written by Len Silverston and
published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Copyright 2001. These books have been an
excellent reference and useful design guide for handling business oriented data.
Open For Business uses a variation on the models in the book, but many concepts
from the book are still recognizable, enough so that it is very worth it to buy
these books.</p>


<p>In addition to using widely accepted and detailed standards, Open For
Business is also using design and architecture patterns that represent best
practices which have been used and improved over the years. These patterns make
the software more reliable and flexible. They also make it easier for developers
to customize and enhance the software because developers familiar with the
patterns and their common usage will easily recognize the organization of the
software and be able to find and modify the desired components quickly.</p>


<p>The patterns used in the project now include:</p>


<ul>
  <li>General Patterns: Interface, Factory, Singleton, Double Checked Locking,
    Composite, Facade, Mediator</li>
  <li>Presentation Tier: Intercepting Filter, Front Controller, View Helper,
    Dispatcher View, Composite View</li>
  <li>Business Tier: Business Delegate, Value Object, Composite Entity, Value
    Object Assembler, Service Locator, Data Transfer HashMap
Generic Attribute Access</li>
  <li>Integration Tier: Data Access Object</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other common patterns will be used throughout the project as they apply
and as they can be implemented. For more information about these patterns visit
the <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/patterns/">Sun
J2EE Patterns page</a> and <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/resources/patterns_review.jsp">TheServerSide.com
patterns resources page</a>. Sun has published a book based on the work on the
above references Sun J2EE Patterns page called &quot;Core J2EE Patterns&quot;,
which is an excellent reference. Information about some of the more general
patterns can be found in the classic Gang of Four &quot;Design Patterns&quot;
book (Addison Wesley), or the &quot;Patterns in Java&quot; books (Vols 1 &amp;
2) by Mark Grand (Wiley).</p>


<p>You may be asking yourself why is this project open source, and how the
contributors to the project are going to make any money?  The answer is here in the
<a href="whyopensource.html">Why Open Source?</a> document.</p>
