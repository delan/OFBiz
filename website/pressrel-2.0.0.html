<h4>Press Release for Open For Business Version 2.0.0</h4>

<p class='contenttext'>The Open For Business Project released version 2.0.0 of 
its business automation tools, components, and applications on Monday the 20th
of January 2003. This is the first stable release of the project and offers a 
new option for organizations of all types that have asked the question of Build 
vs. Buy. More information about Open For Business can be found on the web site 
at <a href="http://www.ofbiz.org" target="_blank">www.ofbiz.org</a>.</P>


<p class='contenttext'>The vision of the Open For Business Project is to embrace 
and enable the 5 E's: Ease of Cost, Ease of Installation, Ease of Customization, 
Ease of Integration, and Ease of Use.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>Organizations using OFBiz can shorten enterprise
information project cycles by months through a well designed architecture and 
corresponding framework and through pre-built components and applications.
The goal of the Open For Business project is to provide useful, standards 
compliant tools and applications. These standards will include: XML; J2EE; 
WfMC; BPML; ebXML; UNSPSC; GAAP &amp; FASB; OMG's GL, Party, Workflow, etc;
ArapXML; OAGIS; and many others.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>The OFBiz Core Framework consists of the following
tools: Entity Engine, Service Engine, Workflow Engine, Rule Engine, XML
Mini-Languages, and a web application framework.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>Applications and application components (including
entities and services) in the project cover the following business areas:
e-commerce, products, orders, parties, facilities, work efforts, content, 
marketing, accounting, human resources, and so forth.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>The most mature and deployed application in the suite is
the e-commerce application with functionality that measures up to the largest 
available commercial alternatives and many live sites, including the
<a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/article.asp?id=8137" target="_blank">award-winning</a> 
ReturnBuy.com site.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>Other OFBiz applications and components are stable and 
being used by various organizations and in various commercial products. More 
details are available on the website.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>OFBiz has received great attention in the open source
and IT communities. The project has been featured on SourceForge and release notices have 
appeared on FreshMeat.net, TheServerSide.com, and JavaLobby.org. The SourceForge
project site shows around 100,000 downloads and 700,000 page views. Dozens of
users of the project have contributed feedback, new ideas and even code and
designs. Special thanks to the many users who have contributed to the project.
Without user contributions the project could not be what it is today.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class='contenttext'><b>Question</b>: What is the scope of the OFBiz 
applications, and how will vertical markets be targeted?</p>
<p class='contenttext'><b>Answer</b>: We realize that we cannot target all
functionality that will be needed by all organizations, or even all markets or
industries. Our goal for the
applications and application components is to include as much generic
functionality as possible. This will allow many medium and large size
organizations to get something useful running quickly and make it possible to
concentrate resources on organization specific customizations.
Software companies will be able to affordably create products 
for narrowly targeted markets or industries and spend time and effort on the
needs of that market or industry instead of all of the generic functionality and
framework components that can be generalized among all users of the software.</p>
<li>
<p class='contenttext'><b>Question</b>: If there are no licensing fees or 
corporate backing for OFBiz, how is the development and support of the project financed?</p>
<p class='contenttext'><b>Answer</b>: The project is financed by providing for 
the needs of users of the project. This is done by offering services such as
analysis, design, implementation, customization, training, mentoring, support
and even prioritization of planned features. Much of the functionality in the 
project has been paid for by commercial adopters of the project and the rest has 
been contributed by generous developers from their own peronal time. For more
information on services offered, see the
