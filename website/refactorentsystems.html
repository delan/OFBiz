<P>This 
paper describes issues related to the goal of unifying the various disparate 
components of current business systems.  Current enterprise-wide systems 
are usually made up of a number of individual applications that communicate 
through batch data transfer, messaging and transaction middleware, or 
APIs.  This approach requires independent maintenance of many systems 
that are often quite different as well as maintenance of the links between 
them.  On top of having disparate systems inside an organization is 
the problem of even more disparate systems outside the organization 
such as those of partners or clients.&nbsp;</P>
<P>In some large businesses this 
seems to work all right because divisions of the business are often 
as fragmented as the systems they use.  Even in those situations greater 
efficiency could be achieved through systems that communicate and operate 
in a more uniform way.  Small and medium sized businesses cannot generally 
afford the cost of maintaining so many disparate systems, so much of 
the functionality found in the systems of large businesses is not found 
among smaller businesses.&nbsp;</P>
<P>This problem has no immediately 
apparent solution.  Because vendors of different vertical applications 
do similar things in so many different ways, tighter integrations between 
them are difficult.  Over the history of enterprise computing some horizontal 
pieces of enterprise systems that can be shared among vertical applications 
have started to become their own pieces.  The first major example of 
this was using databases as a common persistent storage mechanism.  
More recently some businesses have tried to standardize as much as possible 
on many other horizontal pieces of the system such as: analysis tools 
such as reporting and ad-hoc query tools, operating systems, programming 
languages and so forth.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Refactoring enterprise automation 
systems is the idea of identifying pieces of vertical applications that 
can be converted to common use or horizontal components, then creating those horizontal components
and using a common set of them as the foundation for all of the vertical applications in the enterprise-wide system.  
A system like this has many advantages.  It is easier to maintain because 
the same skill-set can be used throughout the enterprise and it is more efficient 
to build and customize because tools that are used a lot will be available 
as part of the core foundation.  Less code will have to be written, 
tested and maintained because more of it will be shared.  No one (or 
very few people) would want to write their own compiler, operating system, 
database, web server or many other components because it requires a 
lot of work and very stable and affordable options are available.  In 
the future more and more components of enterprise systems will be viewed 
in this way.  Some components of vertical applications cannot be shared 
because they are unique to certain operations, but the industry as a 
whole is far from reaching the point where all possible components of vertical
applications are 
turned into horizontal components.&nbsp;</P>
<P>This is one of the main goals 
for the development efforts of the Open For Business Project.  Our goal is 
to provide an enterprise-wide business automation system as a service 
to those who use.  We plan to do this by building a large set 
of vertical applications that all operate on a common foundational 
framework.  As much of the functionality as possible will live in the 
foundation layer as horizontal components and will be common among 
all of the vertical applications in the system.&nbsp;
