<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>

<p>As a software developer I believe in the open source concept.  Many people have asked me why open source is a good idea and how it could work.Many people have arguments against open source, and some of them are very valid.</p>

<p>Open source software goes against the traditional software
development company model of build software and then sell it for as much as you
can, with as high a volume as you can.  Traditional software companies have an extremely hard time when the
economy slows down, but open source companies can flourish either way.  Another trend of open source companies is
that software developers and customers win while software company management and sales/marketing lose.  I hope that
after an explanation of why this is the case that you will be able to see why
some people like open source, and others loathe it as the threat to their
career that it is.</p>

<p>One thing to remember with open source software is that
different business models are needed for different types of software.  Consumer oriented software is the toughest
to build in the open source model, and enterprise software is the easiest.  The greatest success stories of the open
source world are software packages that become basic building blocks or provide
specialized features to companies.  The
consulting model I describe here is centered around enterprise software that
companies use to operate more efficiently or on a greater scale.</p>

<p><b><u>Software Quality and Development Efficiency</u></b></p>

<p>There has been some argument about which type of project results in the best quality software, and which type of project is the most efficient.  Many open source proponents argue that open source software is generally higher quality than closed source software.  I agree that this is generally what happens, although open source does not high quality software make.</p>

<p>Open source software works best when developed in active
communities with a number of different interests represented.  In that case the product is seen by more
people, especially the source code of the product.  Features are more carefully selected and better designed and
implemented.  Sometimes it takes a
number of iterations, but the software gets there, and it works well when it
gets there.</p>

<p>Projects like Apache and Linux are classic examples of large
packages that work well together and are recognized throughout the industry as
being reliable and stable.  Products
built on top of Apache and Linux are becoming more and more popular because of
this.</p>

<p><b><u>Open Source Software Company vs. Traditional Software
Company</u></b></p>

<p>First I would like to describe my preferred open source
business model, and then compare that business model with the traditional
software business model.</p>

<p>There are many different potential open source software
development business models, just as there are many traditional or closed
source software development business models.  I will describe one potentially successful open source model, and then
compare open versus closed source companies in as general terms as possible.</p>

<p>One good open source business model is centered around
consulting.  There is no management
except what would fall under the CTO of a traditional software company.  No sales, marketing or administration is
needed.  Some accounting will still be
necessary, after all this is open source but we don't always work for
free.  The primary revenue for this
business comes from custom projects, installation, support, training, and other
activities charged for on a time and materials basis.  All of the software developed is open sourced and enters the pool
of candidate code for certain open source projects maintained by this company,
or other entities.</p>

<p>How would this work?  How can the company live without sales, marketing and administration
people?  Such people could be useful in
the organization, but there is no need for marketing or sales because people
actively search out open source projects, and communities are naturally
developed in special interest groups related to the project.</p>

<p>Can revenues really come from an open source company like
this?  Recently IBM announced that over
half of their revenue now comes from services, not product licensing or
sales.  Many organizations have no
products, just services, but a mix of both seems to be the best.</p>

<p>In a traditional software company, where does all of the
revenue go?  Even in startup product
based companies usually 20% or less of the budget goes toward development
expenses.  When companies sell developer
time they charge a lot, usually $150-$200 per hour as a middle range, and pay
the developers only $30-$50 per hour.  So why such a margin?  How else
will certain roles in the company be provided for.</p>

<p>Even given all of the money that traditional software
companies charge for their products and services, they still manage to spend a
lot more and go out of business very easily, especially in an unstable economy
where economy of scale based revenues tend to disappear as the market toughens
up.</p>

<p>Projects and features would be created based on what a
customer wants.  Customers are empowered
and get to choose the features they want, and can cheaply get the software to
support their business model.   Customers
no longer need to live with the way a software company thinks their business
should be run.  And, the open source
software company is not limited by demands of management, owners, or venture
capitalists.</p>

<p>Basically the money from services alone could cover
development, services, and minimal administration if marketing, sales and
ownership based administration are removed.  So who benefits?  Mostly, the
current under-dogs: developers and customers.  Who loses:  traditional software
company owners, administrators, and marketing and sales personnel.  So who is not going to like open source?</p>

<p><b><u>Concerns of Developers</u></b></p>

<p>The funny thing is that many software developers and
software customers don't like the open source model either.  There are a number of valid concerns, but if
handled right (just like a traditional software company has to be handled
right), an open source based company can prosper and customers can benefit.</p>

<p>Developers seem to be concerned about getting paid.  Most developers are not used to having any
rights to their own work, and that is what they trade for being paid.  Unfortunately this sometimes leads to huge
legal disputes because companies want erase developers minds when they leave.  This isn't always true in consulting
companies.  The consulting company, or
consultant, often maintains ownership of the software and the customer who
sponsored the project has non-exclusive, but otherwise nearly unlimited, use of
the software.</p>

<p>With open source projects the developers never have to worry
about losing the work that they have done, and they can always use it in future
projects even after leaving the company.  Also, if the company goes under or a certain client drops their support
half way through the project, what happens?  Since it is open source, and the most recent work is always being
published, users or customers will be aware of what the feature is and chances
are someone will be interested in paying the developer to finish the project.</p>

<p>Developers will also benefit because they get public
recognition for their work and if their work is good job options are good.  Even on the side consulting options for very
attractive rates become common place because companies depend on good people to
support the software that runs their business.</p>

<p><b><u>Concerns of Customers</u></b></p>

<p>Customers also usually have a number of concerns.  One of the main concerns is support options
and the reliability of the product and the software company.  What does a customer do if they have a
problem with the product, or can't find a certain option?  What does a customer do if the maker of the
software goes out of business?</p>

<p>Most traditional software companies charge for their
services, except the most basic support services which are included in the
initial purchase for a limited period of time and then maintenance fees are
charged to continue receiving basic support services.  My experience with complicated software has been that when you
have a tough question, you will be referred to their consultants who will solve
your problem on a time and materials basis.  Some companies do better than this, but don't expect too much.</p>

<p>This is the common lie of traditional software companies.  They say: the software is good upfront and
worth the license fee; we will include installation and support with the software (no mention of
how much).  Usually the amount of services included with the license is not specified.  The
software company wants less services included, and they fight for that, and the customer wants
more services included with the up-front license, and they fight for that.  Sometimes customers
take legal action for that.</p>

<p>An open source software company will be honest and up front
about how your problem will be solved: you let us know what your problem is, we
give a time and cost estimate, you decide yes or no or change the requirements,
and off the solution to the problem goes.  Some problems will not need this much involvement.  A post to a newsgroup will get looked at by
various people because that is where they look for jobs too, and if it's an
easy problem someone will still want to do it because they build a relationship
with the customer and future work will come their way.  </p>

<p>It is true that customers will not have the warm fuzzies
usually associated with quality guarantees and promises of traditional software
companies.  But they will have solid
quality from responsible software developers who they can build a relationship
with.  At any time if a developer's work
is not valuable to the customer, another developer in the community can be
found, so developers will do what they can to keep their clients happy.</p>

<p>What happens to the customer if the open source project goes
away?  This doesn't happen very often,
but even if it did the customer would have a number of things that the customer
would not have with a traditional company going under.  And yes, even large traditional software
companies go under when things get tough.  The customer would still have access to the rest of the community, and
with enough interest part of the community would likely step in and restart the
project.  Also, the customer would still
have access to developers in the community that can help fix problems.</p>

<p>What happens to the customer when the product changes?  This is an area where open source
software has great benefits.  An open source product/project is has no licensing costs when you
first implement it.  The only costs are installation, training, and maybe some customization.
For a new version of open source software the costs are the same as with a new purchase or 
installation except that the customer will already have experience with the software.  This price
is much less than purchasing an upgrade license, or even worse, paying ongoing license maintenance fees.</p>

<p>Another concern with open source software for customers is that as the project goes on things
change, even things effecting the customizations they have done.  That means that customizations
may have to be redone or modified.  If customizations are tracked well, this is a controlable cost
and one that exists with both open source and closed source products.  With open source this is
at least easier because a customer can keep an eye on what the project is doing and planning for
the future.  This can also be done before customizations so that conflicts are avoided.</p>

<p><b><u>Concerns of Investors</u></b></p>

<p>Investors usually have a different role with an open source
company.  Often investors are customers
as well, and so every that applies to customers applies to them as well.</p>

<p>What about investors in the open source software company
that want a profit from it?  Investors
might be needed up front to get the project started and create something that
potential customers would be interested in.  Usually this is not the case with open source projects.  A couple of experienced developers can throw
together something to get clients or customers interested who then pay the
developers to create the features they want, and boom the company is up, with
no "investors."</p>

<p>What if an open source software company wanted help with
realizing growth potential, and an investor seemed like a good way to do
it?  What is an investor supposed to
think about an open source operation?  Many open source business models make it hard for an investor to become
interested.  </p>



<p>Investors usually want to see a product that can be created
for a certain cost, and then sold many times without incurring too much
additional cost.  This is a very
convenient sounding but fairy tale business model for companies that create
complex enterprise oriented software.  Complex software, and often even simple software, requires training and
support and customization services.  That is the real world.  </p>



<p>A wise investor could profit a great deal from an open
source software company if there is an understanding of what the company is,
and what the company is not.  In the
consulting model described above nearly all revenues could be considered
profits, so a percentage of revenue agreement would be feasible.  That may not be attractive to a developer
who is basically selling a percentage of future wages.  Also, this is a problem because what if the
burden is found to be too heavy, and the developers decide to abandon the
company, and continue the open source project outside of the company.</p>



<p><b><u>Closed Source Extensions of Open Source Projects</u></b></p>



<p>One business model that may be profitable is to build closed
source software based on open source projects.  Even if these closed source products are based on open source software,
they will still have all of the problems of closed source companies mentioned
above.  The main advantage of doing this
is faster development times for the closed source software since the open
source software can get the product most of the way there, and then added
modules or extensions just fill in the missing pieces.</p>



<p>Customers of closed source products based on open source
software have an added advantage of lower costs because most of the
functionality is free and open source.  The product is also likely to be more reliable because the developers
will have community approved principles and methods to build their software on.</p>



<p>One difficulty with this model is that customers may expect
the closed source vendor to support the open source portion of the software as
well, which will add expenses.  Because
this is sometimes one of the more significant costs to a software company, and
to customers, the warm fuzzy guarantee of traditional software extended to the
open source portion may cut into profits.</p>


<p><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>



<p>It may be that forcing revenues from open source software
companies will not be possible.  Open
source software companies give a big thing to their customers: the customer does
not have to continue paying if the service level is too low, they can go
elsewhere.  What is good about
this?  Finally software developers will
be responsible for the work they do, lest they lose clients.  Clients or customers will get the service
they pay for, and will not get an angry employee of a company that charges 3 or
4 times what they pay the employee to support other roles in the company that
the customer doesn't care as much about.  Customers are no longer bound to a product as it stands, but have the
freedom to get what they want from the project.</p>
