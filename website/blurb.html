The Open For Business Project released the newest version (1.0 Beta 1) of its business automation 
  tools, components, and applications on Monday October 29, 2001. More information 
  can be found on the Open For Business web site at http://www.ofbiz.org or on 
  the Open For Business SourceForge project site at http://sf.net/projects/ofbiz.
<p>The
over-arching vision of the Open For Business Project is to embrace and enable
the 5 E's: Ease of Cost, Ease of Installation, Ease of Customization, Ease of
Integration, and Ease of Use.
<p>The tools and components available can shorten J2EE business project cycles by months through a well designed architecture, pre-built components, and
a dynamic entity model based data source abstraction layer. The goal of the Open
For Business project is to provide useful, standards compliant tools and
applications. These standards will include: XML; J2EE; WfMC's XPDL; BPML; ebXML;
GAAP &amp; FASB; OMG's GL, Party, etc; ArapXML; and other leading standards that
relate to the various tools, components and applications of Open For Business
(see http://www.ofbiz.org for more details).
<p>The Open For Business Project currently includes the following features:
<ul>
<li>-- Data Model -- A work-in-progress data model with nearly 400 entities providing for business data needs such as content, party (person and organization), product, order, shipment, work effort, accounting, human resources, and security data. All main entities have related tables making them extensible for flexibility.
  Around 30% of the data model is in a stable state where application flows have
  been implemented on the data model and missing features added that were
  required for the flows. The rest of the data model will be refined as
  applications are implemented.
<li>-- eCommerce -- An eCommerce application that is based on this flexible and
  enterprise wide data model allowing it to be surpisingly easy to customize and
  easy to integrate with enterprise systems, that is until Open For Business can
  provide those enterprise systems in addition to an eCommerce application. The
  template site has a clean look and feel and provides all of the basic needs
  for eCommerce including a dynamic catalog, customer information management,
  and order history and status.
<li>-- Entity Engine -- The OFBiz Entity Engine provides a simple and
  powerful API for data source independent retrieval and manipulation of data.
  The API is dynamic so that no entity specific persistence or encoding/decoding
  code ever needs to be written, not even an entity bean of some sort like the
  EJB CMP and JDO specifications require. Changing entity definitions is as easy
  as changing an XML file, or using the entity editor, running a data source
  synchronization routine (to automatically create tables or columns or a
  database), and then change the user facing code that displays or handles the
  input of that data. Integrating with other systems is as easy as writing a
  data layout contract in XML in the form of entity definitions, and then moving
  on to your business and display logic, or reusing existing business and
  display logic based on existing entity definitions. The patterns used in
the Entity Engine include: Business Delegate, Value Object, Composite Entity
(variation), Value Object Assembler, Service Locator, Data Access Object, Data Transfer HashMap and
Generic Attribute Access.
<li>-- Servlet Controller -- A servlet controller to abstract non-presentation logic, security and
  web application flow. It implements the following J2EE patterns: Intercepting
  Filter, Front Controller, View Helper, and Dispatcher View. The Composite View
  pattern is used for organization of views in the JSPs of the project.
<li>An event scheduler along with the controller to provide asynchronous repeated actions
<li>Core utilities to provide services such as input validation, output formatting, property file access and caching, conditional debug logging, and date and time handling
<li>A cache utility which supports caches of limited or unlimited size, element expiration, least recently used (LRU) element removal, and a web based cache management application
<li>The default database is MySQL and the default application server is Tomcat
  4.0, or Catalina Optional portions of the project which need an EJB container
  include build and deployment scripts for JBoss. Deployment on other databases and application servers is easily done, including commercial databases and application servers. MySQL, Tomcat
  and JBoss were chosen because they are freely avaiable, facilitating evaluation and proof of concept,
  and initial product development. They are also sufficient for many final
  deployment circumstances.
  <li>The Open For Business Project currently has 52 developers involved from 
    around the world. More are joining all the time. There is a large need for 
    developers because of the wide variety and large number of applications that 
    will be built. The SourceForge site statistics currently report almost 27,000 
    page hits and 5,000 downloads since the project began. These numbers are ever 
    increasing and demonstrate the popularity of the project in spite of the fact 
    that this release contains the first real application based on the framework 
    and architecture that has been developed. 
</ul>
<p>So what does the future of Open For Business look like? A quick glance at the
architecture diagrams on our web site will reveal that we have barely begun to
implement all of the planned components and applications that are planned. The
future will bring rules, contraint and workflow engines, data analysis and
content and knowledge management tools, and a whole suite of enterprise
applications ranging everywhere from eCommerce to Warehouse Management to
Accounting to Human Resources to Sales Force and Marketing Automation.&nbsp;
<p>If it needs to be done in general business, it will be done in Open For
Business. And if it's not done in general business, but is specific to your
industry or particular company, it will be easy to build and integrate with Open
For Business.
<p>Services based on the Open For Business Project are available through affiliated consultants and companies. For more information see Services tab of the Open For Business site at www.ofbiz.org.
