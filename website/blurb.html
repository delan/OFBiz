<p>The Open For Business Project has just released the newest version of its tools and components for J2EE based business automation applications. More information can be found at the Open For Business web site at http://www.ofbiz.org or at the Open For Business SourceForge project site at http://sf.net/projects/ofbiz.
<p>The tools and components available can shorten J2EE business project cycles by months through a well designed architecture, pre-built components, and a code generator to ease and speed the creation of entity beans, deployment descriptors, SQL scripts, JSP web pages and application events. The generated code is made to take advantage of the core components included in the project.
<p>The Open For Business Project currently includes the following features:
<ul>
<li>A work-in-progress data model with over 400 entities providing for business data needs such as content, party (person and organization), product, order, shipment, work effort, accounting, human resources, and security data. All main entities have related tables making them extensible for flexibility.
<li>A servlet controller to abstract non-presentation logic, security and application flow
<li>An event scheduler along with the controller to provide asynchronous repeated actions
<li>Core utilities to provide services such as input validation, output formatting, property file access and caching, conditional debug logging, and date and time handling
<li>A cache utility which supports caches of limited or unlimited size, element expiration, least recently used (LRU) element removal, and a web based cache management application
<li>A code generator for entity related code that automatically creates SQL scripts, entity EJBs, advanced architected helper classes, deployment descriptors, data update events for our control servlet, and data maintenance JSPs supporting find, create, update, and delete operations. Entities are described in a XML file. Finders and entity relations are modeled in the XML file and used by the code generator to make retrieval and maintenance of entities and their related entities easier. The templates are written in plain JSP and can be extended by anyone with JSP experience.
<li>The default database is MySQL and the default application server is JBoss with Tomcat.Deployment on other databases and application servers is easily done, including commercial databases and application servers. MySQL, JBoss and Tomcat were chosen because they are freely avaiable, facilitating evaluation and proof of concept development.
<li>The Open For Business Project currently has 24 developers involved from around the world. More are joining all the time. There is a large need for developers because of the wide variety and large number of applications that will be built. The SourceForge site statistics currently report around 12,000 page hits and 2,400 downloads since the project began. These numbers are ever increasing.
</ul>
<p>Services based on the Open For Business Project are available through affiliated consultants and companies. For more information see Services tab of the Open For Business site at www.ofbiz.org.
