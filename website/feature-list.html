      <li class="contenttext">For products with variants can display small images for each of the features of the first selectable feature type; a useful application of this is having the color be the first selectable feature type and having small images for each different color; when large images are associated with the variant products the large image will change as corresponding features are selected in the drop-down(s)
      <li class="contenttext">Displays links to previous and next products in the current category for easy browsing through the details of a given category
