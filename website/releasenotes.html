<h4>No Cookie Session Management Support</h4>
<p>A call to reponse.encodeURL has been added to all <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000c0">&lt;a
href&gt;</font>s and all <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000c0">&lt;form action&gt;</font>s to support session management
with cookies turned off. All existing JSPs in the project support this, and all JSPs generated by entitygen support this.

<h4>Cache Management</h4>
<p>Three JSPs have been added along with a number of web event handlers and
extensions to the UtilCache class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all, a number of bugs have been fixed in the UtilCache class making
the caches actually work now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The expire feature has been enhanced so that whenever get() or containsKey()
are called hasExpired() is checked and on expiration the element is removed from
the cache. The get() method will then return null, not being able to find the
element, and the containsKey() method will return false, also not being able to
find the element. This becomes simply a cache hit and the routine which uses the
cache will load the value the normal way.</p>

<p>All caches have a name that they pass to the constructor and then
initialization parameters are loaded from the conf/cache.properties file. If no
name is passed, a default name is used with a number appended to it to make it
unique. A Hashtable now stores a collection of all of the caches so that they
can be maintained easily through a generic maintenance utility.</p>

<p>The JSPs that have been added are common/FindUtilCache.jsp, common/EditUtilCache.jsp,
and common/FindUtilCacheElements.jsp. All cache parameters can now be viewed in
real time including cache size, hitCount and missCount, and maxSize and
expireTime can not only be viewed by changed through the JSP interface. The
pages are permission protected using the security system. Individual cache lines
can now also be viewed, and removed, through the JSP interface.</p>

<h4>Security Speed Enhancements</h4>
<p>The Security class now has two caches (using UtilCache) to speed up the
hasPermission() and hasEntityPermission() methods. The first cache stores a
collection of security groups for each person. If a person belongs to no
security groups, an empty collection is put into the cache so that those look
ups will be fast too. The second cache corresponds to the
SecurityGroupPermission entity and caches Boolean values keyed on a
SecurityGroupPermissionPK. The Boolean value is true if the corresponding
SecurityGroupPermission entity exists in the database, or false if it does not.</p>

<h4>EntityPK Class Enhancement</h4>
<p>All EntityPK, or primary key, classes now override the toString() method to make display of primary key information more simple and consistent.</p>

<h4>Initial Release</h4>
<p>This initial release includes the first version of the Entity Code Generator (entitygen) module 
and the basic pieces of the Common Application Components (commonapp) module.</p>
<p>The entitygen module represents a first round attempt using JSPs as templates to generate Java code (including Entity EJBs), 
SQL table creation code, XML deployment descriptors, and JSP user interfaces to manage entities defined in XML descriptor files
which resemble the ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor.
<p>The commonapp module will eventually contain all of the core entities that any enterprise would likely need to run their business.
At the moment it is only the frameword to support the code generated by entitygen. This includes a security framework, a caching framework,
output formatting utilities, the web event handler (removes non-display logic from JSPs), and a basic user interface layout.
