<h1>Theoretical Concepts</h1><p>
<ul><li><h2>No Object-Relational Mapping</h2>
<ul><li>Data is all relational, front to back, meaning no extra object to relation and relation to object translation code
<li>Relational data is also the data structure used in logic, or rules, languages providing a seamless integration between the Rules Engine and the Entity Engine
</ul><li><h2>Very Few Objects in Applications</h2>
<ul><li>Functionality implemented as events and services that are static Java methods, BeanShell scripts, rulesets or workflows
<li>Data is manipulated directly in entities rather than using an object model
</ul></ul></body>
