<p><b><u>1. The Nature of the Opportunity</u></b></p>

<p>The Open For Business Project is part of a new trend in enterprise software
that will change the nature of businesses and departments that create, maintain, use, 
and customize enterprise software. The Open Source Software (OSS) movement is changing
organization and compensation patterns of software development for many types of
software. Early on the primary focus of open source software was on infrastructure
software such as operating systems like Linux or web servers like Apache.

<p>These open source efforts have challenged the traditional commercial players 
in the markets they compete in and many customers are choosing open source options 
over the commercial alternatives because of the benefits often found in the
resulting software. While it is true that one of the benefits is usually lower
licensing costs (although sometimes that is offset by packaging costs), the true 
benefit to customers and end users is an opportunity to participate in a community
that is working together so that all can benefit from the shared resources applied
to the development of functionality that everyone in the community needs. The 
result is that customers and end users will have what they need to
build the features that they need for their specific business or industry, 
namely a source code base to work from and more available resources.</p>

<p>As time moves on the focus of Open Source Software efforts is expanding. No 
longer is it limited to low level infrastructure technology. Efforts are appearing
that are targeting higher level needs of enterprises. These include J2EE 
implementations (Tomcat, Jetty, JBoss, Exolab), reporting tools (Jasper Reports, 
DataVision), and even eCommerce, ERP and CRM projects (GNUE, Compiere, OFBiz).</p>

<p>Higher level enterprise software such as eCommerce, ERP and CRM software will
represent a major change in the way open source software is created and used. At
the moment enterprises continually have a difficult decision between building and
buying. A third option is becoming viable for more and more organizations. This is
the Open Source Software option.</p>

<p>With a closed source package 80% of the functionality an organization needs 
is often included and then the organization spends 2-10 times as much money as
the acquisition cost of the package (or more) adding the remaining 20%. Sometimes certain 
functionality cannot be added for a reasonable amount of money because of
the way the package was implemented.</p>

<p>With an open source package the upfront costs may include packaging and other costs
or may include only the cost of downloading the software. This leaves a larger
budget for customization which will also be cheaper because the original package
is open source, and in the case of OFBiz, meant to be customized. Hundreds of 
people will have provided feedback to the community about customization making it 
easier and cheaper to perform the needed changes.</p>

<p>The goal of the Open For Business Project is to provide a framework on which 
enterprise applications can be easily built and to use that framework to build
high quality best practices enterprise applications that can be easily customized 
as needed by those who adopt and use the software.</p>

<p>To accomplish this goal many resources will be needed to develop the 
framework and the applications. Also, to ensure that the features of the 
applications are adequate and that the quality of the software is good there
is a major need for adoption of the project by end user "customers" and by
software firms that provide services related to the project.</p>

<p>The benefits of being involved for end users or "customers" are described
above and apply for the applications and functionality that already exists in
the project. This group can also benefit from collaborating with others who are
interested in similar features to share the costs of developing those features
as part of the open source project.</p>

<p>For services organizations the benefits are somewhat different. They are
related to the benefits of their clients because as end users of the project their 
clients will appreciate the benefits mentioned above. This will make it easier
for the services company to compete with other services companies who are 
customizing closed source software or who are building software on an ad-hoc 
basis for their clients.</p>

<p>Services organizations that get involved early with Open For Business will
have to assume some additional risk because much of the software planned for in
OFBiz has not yet been written. These organizations will also enjoy additional
rewards because their early involvement and experience with the software, giving
them an advantage over other organizations who are just getting started with
the technology.</p>

<p><b><u>2. Effective Management of Risk</u></b></p>

<p>The greatest risks of the Open For Business Project are related to the 
development of the software to the point where it will be useful to end user 
organizations. The cost of software development is generally very high, but that
is not usually the reason that projects fail. The unpredictable nature of 
software development and the establishment of business processes can sometimes
cause the cost of implementation to go beyond the resources available, or the
resources that can be found by even the most creative means when the planned for
resources are exhausted.</p>

<p>Ensuring the success of the project by effectively managing the risks is being
done by producing the software in such a way that no one owns it and can shut it
down or restrict its use, and by keeping the development effort completely free 
of any investment burden. This allows the project to progress unhindered and even
if it must slow down at times because those involved start to get hungry, as soon
as additional interest in the project can be found along with available resources
the project continues again.</p>

<p>In other words, the software is developed purely from contributions by those 
who wish to use the software. Those contributions are just that, unburdened 
contributions that cannot be withdrawn and that allow the project to progress
without the fear of falling back for economic reasons.</p>

<p>The involvement of organizations that stand to profit from the use of the 
software is necessary and finding organizations that are willing to contribute
to that end has been successful so far. The future goal of the project is to
attract more contributing organizations so that the effort can move along more
quickly.</p>

<p><b><u>3. Management's Ability to Carry Out Goals of the Project</u></b></p>

<p>The original founders of Open For Business, David E. Jones and Andrew Zeneski,
are software engineers and architects. They have experience with business 
software, but additional expertise in a number of fields such as accounting,
procurement, sales, marketing, and so forth will be necessary to produce the 
best practices applications that are part of the goals of the Open For Business 
Project. Additional skills may also be needed in coordinating and assuring the
quality of the effort.</p>

<p>These additional skills will be found through collaboration with end user
and services organizations, or through the contributions of people with such 
skills who for whatever reason desire to contribute to the open source effort.</p>

<p><b><u>4. Strategic Relationships that will Foster the Goals of the Project</u></b></p>

<p>Strategic relationships with the OFB Group and the Open For Business Project
are a vital part of continued success of the project. The goals of OFBiz can 
only be effectively achieved by working with those who are using the project in
their day-to-day business activities.</p>

<p>These strategic relationships may exist in one of a number of different forms. The
relationship may include OFB Group Certification as an Affiliated Services 
Organization, and inclusion in the list of Certified Affiliates on the ofbgroup.com
website. This is the sole purpose of the OFB Group which is run by those who
are running the Open For Business Project.</p>

<p>The relationship may also include paying developers and organizers to push
forward the goals of OFBiz. While there is a need for salaried developers to work
on Open For Business, the founders desire to work only as consultants so that 
their coordinating role in OFBiz will not be compromised by the goals and 
priorities of one of the many adopters of and contributors to OFBiz.</p>

<p><b><u>5. The Project's Market Niche or Basis of Competition in the Market</u></b></p>

<p>The Open For Business Project competes and collaborates with other providers 
of enterprise software, both open and closed source providers. Where competition
exists OFBiz hopes to be the best choice by providing an enterprise software 
framework and enterprise applications that are the most flexible, customization,
complete, and easy to use available.</p>

<p><b><u>6. The Project's Exit Strategy or Equity Appreciation Strategy</u></b></p>

<p>The goal of the Open For Business Project is to develop high quality open 
source enterprise software. The project itself does not exist to seek profit,
but it does exist to assist those who adopt it or use it more efficiently seek
profit. This includes end user organizations and services organizations.</p>

<p>Equity appreciation in the case of the Open For Business Project is a simple
matter of improving the software such that it more effectively enables the users
and adopters of the software to profit in their businesses. This includes but is 
by no means limited to the reduction of the costs associated with procuring and
customizing the software that enables them to run their business more effectively.</p>

<p><b><u>7. Strategies to Resolve Limited Resources</u></b></p>

<p>The resolution of limited resources will be accomplished by fostering the
collaboration of various end users and services organizations to accomplish
the goals of the project. These end users and services organizations will be able
to afford committing additional resources to the development of Open For Business
because of the efficiency improvements made possible by the software and the cost
savings over the alternatives.</p>

<p><b><u>8. Corresponding Risks of Principals and Investors</u></b></p>

<p>The risks of the principals, in this case the founders of OFBiz, and the
investors, in this case those who adopt or sponsor OFBiz, are very similar.
Both hope to acquire software to use that will fill their needs as inexpensively
as possible. Both risk the failure of the implementation of the software in
spite of the resources contributed to it.</p>
