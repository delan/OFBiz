The Open For Business Project is an open source project that provides tools
and applications for business based on Sun's J2EE standard.  The project is intended to be open
and used by a large group of people.  Because of that it is licensed using the
<a href="ofbizmitlicense.html">MIT Open Source License.</a> The MIT license allows adopters of 
the technology to customize, use and even sell it as desired with no obligations other
than a release of liability and a copyright acknowledgement for the original source.

<p>The vision of the Open For Business Project is to embrace and
enable <font size="4">"The 5 'E's"</font>:&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li>Ease of Cost</li>
  <li>Ease of Installation</li>
  <li>Ease of Customization</li>
  <li>Ease of Integration</li>
  <li>Ease of Use</li>
</ol>

<p>On an application level this means providing open source best practices applications based on a 
flexible framework. The flexible framework includes a number of standard tools in addition to the
custom tools provided by the Open For Business Project. The goals behind the design of the 
tools and applications are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Express process, rule, and data definitions in natural languages or XML formats</li>
  <li>Minimize the code and work needed to implement functionality</li>
  <li>Maximize the reuse of existing components</li>
</ol>

<p>The end result of focusing on these goals is that applications will be built, customized, and integrated
fast and cheap. A person that is familiar with the tools and applications in Open For Business will be 
able to quickly and cheaply produce custom software that satisfies the needs of any individual, business or organization.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of the organization and components of the Open For Business tools and applications look
at the General Documents on the <a href='documents.html'>Documentation Page</a>.

<p>There are many standard components and specifications used in Open For Business
to avoid re-inventing the wheel and to make it easier for people to become familiar with
the tools and applications in the project. These standards include: <a href="http://www.w3c.org">XML</a>;
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee">J2EE</a>; <a href="http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/ruleml/">RuleML</a>;
<a href="http://www.wfmc.org/standards/docs.htm">WfMC</a>;
<a href="http://www.bpmi.org">BPML</a>; <a href="http://www.ebxml.org">ebXML</a>;
GAAP &amp; <a href="http://www.fasb.org/">FASB</a>; OMG's <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/omg_business_specs.htm">Workflow</a>,
<a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/omg_finance_specs.htm">GL,
Party</a>, <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/omg_mfg_specs.htm">Product</a>,
etc; <a href="http://www.arapxml.net/">ArapXML</a>; <a href="http://developer.intuit.com/downloads/quickbooks/sdk/">qbXML</a>; and other leading standards
that relate to the various tools, components and applications of The Open For
Business Project.
<p>To help us provide a strong data model foundation for the project we are
using entity designs from various standards bodies, and the The Data Model
Resource Book, Revised Edition, Volumes 1 &amp; 2 written by Len Silverston and
published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Copyright 2001. These books have been an
excellent reference and useful design guide for handling business oriented data.
Open For Business uses a variation on the models in the book, but many concepts
from the book are still recognizable, enough so that it is very worth it to buy
these books.</p>

<p>In addition to using widely accepted and detailed standards, Open For
Business is also using design and architecture patterns that represent best
practices which have been used and improved over the years. These patterns make
the software more reliable and flexible. They also make it easier for developers
to customize and enhance the software because developers familiar with the
patterns and their common usage will easily recognize the organization of the
software and be able to find and modify the desired components quickly.</p>

<p>The patterns used in the project now include:</p>


<ul>
  <li>General Patterns: Interface, Factory, Singleton, Double Checked Locking,
    Composite, Facade, Mediator</li>
  <li>Presentation Tier: Intercepting Filter, Front Controller, View Helper,
    Dispatcher View, Composite View</li>
  <li>Business Tier: Business Delegate, Value Object, Composite Entity, Value
    Object Assembler, Service Locator, Data Transfer HashMap
Generic Attribute Access</li>
  <li>Integration Tier: Data Access Object</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other common patterns will be used throughout the project as they apply
and as they can be implemented. For more information about these patterns visit
the <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/patterns/">Sun
J2EE Patterns page</a> and <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/resources/patterns_review.jsp">TheServerSide.com
patterns resources page</a>. Sun has published a book based on the work on the
above references Sun J2EE Patterns page called &quot;Core J2EE Patterns&quot;,
which is an excellent reference. Information about some of the more general
patterns can be found in the classic Gang of Four &quot;Design Patterns&quot;
book (Addison Wesley), or the &quot;Patterns in Java&quot; books (Vols 1 &amp;
2) by Mark Grand (Wiley).</p>


<p>You may be asking yourself why is this project open source, and how the
contributors to the project are going to make any money?  The answer is here in the
