<H3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></H3>
<hr>
<p>The purpose of this document is to describe the Entities in various components
and their design. A brief overview of each component will be presented which
will include a description of the entities in the component and their relations
to other entities.</p>


<p>There are some files that go along with the definitions of these entities.
These files are located in the "entitydef" directory of each components. The most
important file is generally named something like entitymodel*.xml which contain 
the XML definitions for all of the entities in the project.</p>


<p>Another important set of files is in the "data" directory of each component.
These are XML Entity Engine Import files that contain seed data including 
various entity types for entities in the data
model. For an explanation of what these entity types are and how they are used,
see the Extensibility Pattern section of this document.</p>


<hr>
<H3><a name="Extensibility Pattern">Extensibility Pattern</a></H3>
<hr>
<p>There is one pattern that you will see repeated often in this data model that
warrants some explanation. This pattern is used to make the data model more
flexible and eliminate a great many tables that might otherwise have to exist.
It aids in the conceptualization of the use of an entity that follows this
pattern. It also&nbsp;provides a method for run-time extensibility of the
entities that use this pattern.</p>


<p>For a given Entity there are 3 or 4 related entities that are used to
implement this pattern. These are EntityClass (optional) EntityType,
EntityAttribute, and EntityTypeAttr. Each Entity instance can have one or more
types which are described by EntityType. If an Entity can have multiple types
the EntityClass, or Entity Classification entity is used to implement the
many-to-many relation between Entity and EntityType. Otherwise no EntityClass is
necessary and Entity will have an entityTypeId field.</p>


<p>EntityType is used to describe an Entity. A given EntityType can inherit
features from a parent EntityType if one is specified in the parentTypeId field
of a given EntityType instance. If a table is associated with a given EntityType
instance that has the same name as the entityTypeId field value then the
hasTable field should have the value 'Y', otherwise it should have the value
'N'. A description field is provided for a short description of an EntityType
instance.</p>


<p>EntityAttribute is used to store instances of name-value pair attributes for
a given Entity instance. An attribute can be used in place of a column on the
Entity table, especially when the attribute does not apply to all types of
Entities. Attributes can also be used ad-hoc for any name-value pair information
that applies to a given Entity instance. If many attributes apply to a given
EntityType it may be best to create a separate entity to hold those attributes,
and have that entity be associated with the EntityType instance by naming it the
same as the entityTypeId and setting the hasTable field to 'Y' on the EntityType
instance. This will be faster than repeatedly querying a collection of
attributes for a given Entity instance.</p>


<p>EntityTypeAttr is used to specify which attributes should exist for an Entity
instance that corresponds to a given entityTypeId. The entityTypeId and name
field combinations are listed to specify this. For example, the EntityType with
entityTypeId 'BOX' should always have attributes named 'HEIGHT', 'WIDTH',
'DEPTH', and 'COLOR', so an instance of EntityTypeAttr will exist for each of
these attributes.</p>


<p>There are variations on this pattern for certain entities, but this
description is generally applicable in this data model. Note that the default
types for the data model are defined in ofbiz/commonapp/entitydef/datamodel-data.sql.</p>

The Common package is meant to contain entities that are for general use and may
be used by entities in many other packages.

<H3><a name="Party">Party</a></H3>
<hr>

The Party package is meant to contain entities related to the Party entity.
There are many types of parties, and a lot of data that is associated with a
party or with parties, and that data is defined in this package. Parties include
persons, organizations, and so forth.

<H3><a name="Product">Product</a></H3>
<hr>

The Product package is meant to contain entities related to the Product entity.
There are many types of products, and a lot of data that is associated with a
product or with products, and that data is defined in this package. A Product
can be a good or a service, and each may have various subtypes. Some related
data that is fairly central to Product definitions includes features and
categories. The Category package allows products to be organized, and the
Feature package describes details of a product that may be used for pricing or
in a parametric product search.
<p>The Product package also contains information about serialized and
non-serialized inventory items, and the storage of inventory in facilities which
can be warehouses, stores, or whatever. There is a package for Product cost
estimation, and another for Product price calculation. In addition there is a
package for Product supplier related information to keep track of where a
product might come from and to rate and put a priority on different suppliers of
the same product.</p>

  <b><i><a name="product.product">product.product</a></i></b>
  
&nbsp;
<p>The Product entity contains general information about a product, whatever
type of product it is. Product implements the Extensibility Pattern, and can
have multiple types, using the Product,
    ProductClass,
    ProductType,
    ProductAttribute, and ProductTypeAttr entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a Product is of the type GOOD (as opposed to SERVICE) then it generally
has identifications associated with it such as a SKU, an ISBN, a SKU or catalog
ID from manufacturer or distributor, and so forth. These are stored in the GoodIdentification
entity and the type of good id is defined by the GoodIdentificationType entity.</p>
<p>The ProductAssoc entity implements an association between products. The type
of association is defined by the corresponding ProductAssocType entity.
ProductAssoc partially implements the Extensibility Pattern by providing a type,
but does not have attributes at the moment. ProductAssoc entities can be used to
specify that a certain product is deprecated by another product, or can be
substitued for another product. A Product can also be a 'dummy' product and
simply be a collection of other products that are components of this product, or
the product could be a special offer or marketing package used to promote and
sell various products as a single product. Many other potential associations can
be used between products. Marketing concepts such as up-sells and cross-sells
can also be implemented using ProductAssoc entities.</p>
<p>The ProductDataObject entity is used to implement the many to many join
between a Product and a DataObject. The DataObject entity is part of the Content
package and is used to store text or images or other general content as a
content management package. To simplify the data model the Product entity also
has fields for a long description and URLs to images, but these are optional and
larger organizations will want to use the content management features to control
this sort of content.</p>
<p>
  
  <b><i><a name="product.category">product.category</a></i></b>
  
&nbsp;</p>
<p>ProductCategory contains information about categories of products, and can be
used to organize products for cataloging, marketing, analyis, and other
purposes. ProductCategory implements the Extensibility Pattern, and can have
multiple types, using the
  
    ProductCategory,
    ProductCategoryClass,
    ProductCategoryType,
    ProductCategoryAttribute, and ProductCategoryTypeAttr entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A ProductCategory has a many to many relation with Product meaning that a
Product can belong to many ProductCategories and a ProductCategory can contain
many Products. This many to many relation is joined using the ProductCategoryMember
entity which contains a reference to a Product and a ProductCategory.</p>
<p>A ProductCategory can be related to other product categories in a loose hierarchical
structure. When I say loose I mean that it differs from a normal hierarchy in
that it can have multiple parents, making it really a graph, but we still use
terminology that comes from an hierarchical organization. This many to many
relation is joined using the ProductCategoryRollup entity. An alternative to
this is to implement a true hierarchy by removing or not using the
ProductCategoryRollup entity and simply using a field in the ProductCategory
entity to specify a reference to the ParentProductCategory. This can be done
with the current data model by using the primaryParentCategoryId field as a
reference to the only parent category.</p>

The Security package contains entities related to controlling access to various
parts of applications that use the data model. The Login package has a
UserLogin entity which contains the usernames and passwords of all users on the
system and which is optionally related to a Party entity instance. The Login
package also has an entity which keeps a history of logins into the system.
<p>The SecurityGroup package contains entities used to map SecurityPermissions
to UserLogins. It goes this by mapping a UserLogin to a SecurityGroup and then
mapping the SecurityGroup to a SecurityPermission. In this manner complex
security definitions can be shared efficiently.</p>
