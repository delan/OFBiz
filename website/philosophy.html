<div><b><u>Foundational Concepts</u></b></div>
<br>
The Open For Business Project is an open source software project that provides tools
and applications for business.  The software is freely open
and used by many people and organizations.  To enable that it is licensed using the
<a href="ofbizmitlicense.html">MIT Open Source License.</a> The MIT license allows adopters of 
the technology to customize, use and even sell it as desired with no obligations other
than a release of liability and a copyright acknowledgement for the original source.

<p>The vision of the Open For Business Project is to produce High Quality Custom
Enterprise Software which embraces and enables <span style='font-size: medium;'><b>"The 5
'E's"</b></span>:&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li>Ease of Cost</li>
  <li>Ease of Installation</li>
  <li>Ease of Customization</li>
  <li>Ease of Integration</li>
  <li>Ease of Use</li>
</ol>

<p>Our goal is to make it possible for developers to provide the functionality 
businesses need for 1/10th of the cost and still make twice as much money.
Adding up those numbers it is clear that much more than a free base package is
needed.</p>

<p>We know this goal will require many unconventional differentiating practices. Here
are some of the basic <b>Tenets</b> that will guide the Open For Business Project to this sort of
success:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Massive Collaboration, Usage, and Review</li>
  <li>No Sofware Intellectual Property. Period. Everything Shared, Open and Free. This
is Necessary for Massive Collaboration, Usage, and Review.</li>
  <li>Communicate and Work Directly With the Customers and Users. Get Continual Feedback From
Customers and Users. Educate Them. Let Them Educate You.</li>
  <li>Viciously Use the Best Design and Implementation Practices. Practices that
Work, Not that Sound Good.</li>
  <li>Always Re-Evaluate, Re-Design, and Re-Factor. Keep Improving. This Project
Will Never Be "Done".</li>
  <li>Hit What Matters Hard. Ignore Everything Else.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the software design side our goal is accomplished by producing open source best practices applications based on a 
flexible framework. The flexible framework includes a number of 
custom tools provided by the Open For Business Project in addition to the best tools
and platforms currently available. The goals behind the design of the 
tools and applications are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Express process, rule, and data definitions in "natural" ways</li>
  <li>Minimize the code and work needed to implement functionality</li>
  <li>Maximize the reuse of existing components</li>
</ol>

<p>The end result of focusing on these practices and design goals is that applications will be built, customized, and integrated
fast and cheap. A person that is familiar with the tools and applications in Open For Business will be 
able to quickly and inexpensively produce custom software that satisfies the needs of any individual, business or organization.</p>

<p>To get a better understanding of the organization and components of the Open For Business tools and applications look
at the General Documents on the <a href='documents.html'>Documentation Page</a>.
