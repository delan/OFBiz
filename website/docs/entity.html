<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<hr class="sepbar">
<p>The Open For Business Entity Engine is a set of tools and patterns
used to
model and manage entity specific data. In this context an entity is a
piece of
data defined by a set of fields and a set of relations to other
entities. This
definition comes from the standard Entity-Relation modeling concepts of
Relational Database Management Systems. The goal of the entity engine
is to
simplify the enterprise wide use of entity data. This includes
definition,
maintenance, quality assurance, and development of entity related
functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entity engine uses a number of Business Tier and Integration
Tier
patterns that will be recognized by most enterprise software
programmers. Many
Presentation Tier patterns are also used in the Open For Business
project, but
only in the servlet controller, not in the entity engine. The patterns
used in
the Entity Engine include: Business Delegate, Value Object, Composite
Entity
(variation), Value Object Assembler, Service Locator, and Data Access
Object.
Implementations of other patterns and more complete implementations of
these
Patterns are planned.</p>
<p> Descriptions of these
patterns are all available in the book "Core J2EE Patterns" by Alur,
Crupi, and Malks, published by Sun. You can also find information on
these
patterns at the site that contains the early work of the authors before
the
published book was finished. See <a
 href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/restricted/patterns/J2EEPatternsAtAGlance.html">http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/restricted/patterns/J2EEPatternsAtAGlance.html</a>.
Note that you need a Java Developers Connection account to view this
information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition there are a number of patterns
used from the upcoming book "EJB
Design Patterns" by <a class="undecorated"
 href="mailto:floyd@middleware-company.com">Floyd
Marinescu</a> of TheServerSide.com. These include Data Transfer HashMap
and
Generic Attribute Access. For unique primary key generation we use an
original
pattern we like to call the "Ethernet Key Generation" pattern because
it uses a collision detection mechanism to insure that multiple servers
can use a single
database to get banks of unique keys in a database independent way.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the entity engine is to eliminate the need for
entity
specific persistence code in as many areas of a transactional
application as
possible. Granted that this sort of abstraction is a different issue
for
reporting and similar systems, but for transactional systems such as
are used on
a day to day basis in all businesses, an entity engine can save a great
deal of
development effort and dramatically reduce persistence related bugs in
the
system. These types of applications include everything from ecommerce
to
accounting to inventory and warehouse management to human resources and
so on.
These tools can be useful for reporting and analytical systems, but
really
aren't meant to allow for the wide variety of custom queries that often
take
place in such tools.</p>
<p>In order to achieve having as little entity specific code as
possible, all
value objects are generic, using a map to store the fields values of
the entity
instance by name. The <span style="font-style: italic;">get </span>and
<span style="font-style: italic;">set </span>methods for the fields
take a String with the
fieldName in it which is used to verify that the field is part of the
entity,
and then either get or set a value as desired. The danger of this
flexibility is
curtailed using a contract between the entity engine and the
application; this
is contained in a special XML file.</p>
<p>Instead of writing entity specific code, entity definitions are read
from an
XML file and used by the entity engine to enforce a set of rules
between the
application and the data source, be it a database or some other source.
These XML entity
definitions specify the names of all of the entities and their fields
along with
which database tables and columns they correspond to. They are also
used to
specify a type for each field which is then looked up in the field
types file for
the given data source to find the Java and SQL data types. Relations
between
entities are also defined in this XML file. A relation is defined by
specifying
the related table, the type of relation (one or many) and the keymaps
for the
relation. A title can also be given to the relation which becomes part
of its
name to distinguish it from other relations to that specific related
entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Entity Engine as an abstraction layer, entity specific
code can be
easily created and modified. Code that uses the Entity Engine APIs to
interact
with entities can be deployed in various ways so that entity
persistence can be
done differently without changing the code that interacts with those
entities on
a higher level. An example of the usefulness of this abstraction is
that, by
changing a configuration file, an application written using the Entity
Engine
can switch from hitting a database directly through JDBC to using an
EJB server
and Entity Beans for persistence. The same code could also be used for
custom
data sources like legacy systems over HTTP or messaging services
through a bit of custom coding within the same
framework.</p>

<h3><a name="Entity_Modeling">Entity Modeling</a></h3>
<hr class="sepbar">
<p><b>Entity Modeling Files &amp; Locations</b></p>
<p>The first thing to do when starting work with a new entity is to
define or
model that entity. In the OFBiz Entity Engine this is done through two
XML
files, one for entity modeling and the other for field type modeling.
There are
links to the XML DTDs for these documents in the <a
 href="#Related%20Documents">Related
Documents</a> section above. The reason that these two files are
separated is
that field type definitions can be database specific. In other words,
for a
given entity model definition various field type definitions may exist
for
different databases. When a persistence server is defined the field
type model
XML file to be used for that server is specified.</p>
<p>The main entity model XML files for Open For Business can be found
in <b>ofbiz/commonapp/entitydef/</b>.
Originally all of the entities were in the <b>entitymodel.xml</b>
file, but now they are separated into various files
in addition to the <b>entitymodel.xml</b> file. They are all named
after the following pattern: <b>entitymodel_*.xml</b></p>
<p>The MySQL field type model XML file for Open For Business can be
found in <b>ofbiz/commonapp/entitydef/fieldtypemysql.xml</b>.
There are other database specific field type files for Postgres,
Hypersonic, Oracle, et cetera.
From the entity model files and the field type files database tables
can be created automatically through
the checkDataSource routine on the GenericHelper interface. This can be
done automatically on startup or through the tools in WebTools.</p>
<p><b>Loading Seed Data</b></p>
<p>While tables can be created automatically, data must be loaded from
data files. These
files can be either SQL scripts or XML Entity Engine files. All of the
type information and other
pre-loaded information such as statuses, enumerations, geo data, etc.,
are located in
XML Entity Engine files in <b>ofbiz/commonapp/db/</b>. These files can
be located and loaded automatically
by the <b>install.jsp</b> page in WebTools. This page looks in the
directories specified in
the <b>entityengine.xml</b> file for a given entity group name and
finds all .xml and .sql
files. These are listed and confirmation is requested by the page.
Clicking on the Yes, Load Now link
will cause these files to attempt to be loaded. Error messages will
appear in the page as
well as on the console or in log files. Data files can also be loaded
one at a time by specifying the
full path of the .sql or .xml file in the load a single file form.
While on the topic, XML Entity Engine files
can also be imported and exported through the import &amp; export pages
in WebTools.</p>
<p><b>An Example Entity Definition</b></p>
<p>As mentioned above an entity consists of a set of fields and a set
of
relationships to other entities. In the XML entity definitions each of
these are
specified in addition to attributes of the entity itself such as the
entity
name, the corresponding table name, the package name for the entity,
and meta
data about the entity such as the author, a copyright notice, a
description, and
so forth. Here is an example of an XML entity definition:</p>
<pre
 style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: rgb(238, 238, 255); color: black;">    &lt;entity title="Sample Entity"<br>            copyright="Copyright (c) 2001 John Doe Enterprises"<br>            author="John Doe" version="1.0"<br>            package-name="org.ofbiz.commonapp.sample"<br>            entity-name="SampleEntity"<br>            table-name="SAMPLE_ENTITY"&gt;<br>      &lt;field name="primaryKeyFieldOne" col-name="PRIMARY_KEY_FIELD_ONE" type="id-ne"&gt;&lt;/field&gt;<br>      &lt;field name="primaryKeyFieldTwo" type="id-ne"&gt;&lt;/field&gt;<br>      &lt;field name="fieldOne" type="long-varchar"&gt;&lt;/field&gt;<br>      &lt;field name="fieldTwo" type="long-varchar"&gt;&lt;/field&gt;<br>      &lt;field name="foreignKeyOne" type="id"&gt;&lt;/field&gt;<br>      &lt;prim-key field="primaryKeyFieldOne" /&gt;<br>      &lt;prim-key field="primaryKeyFieldTwo" /&gt;<br>      &lt;relation type="one" rel-entity-name="OtherSampleEntity"&gt;<br>        &lt;key-map field-name="foreignKeyOne" rel-field-name="primaryKeyOne" /&gt;<br>      &lt;/relation&gt;<br>      &lt;relation type="one" title="Self" rel-entity-name="SampleEntity"&gt;<br>        &lt;key-map field-name="primaryKeyFieldOne" /&gt;<br>        &lt;key-map field-name="primaryKeyFieldTwo" /&gt;<br>      &lt;/relation&gt;<br>      &lt;relation type="many" title="AllOne" rel-entity-name="SampleEntity"&gt;<br>        &lt;key-map field-name="primaryKeyFieldOne" /&gt;<br>      &lt;/relation&gt;<br>    &lt;/entity&gt;<br></pre>
<p>This is a pretty simple entity that demonstrates a few small points.
The meta
data at the top is all optional, and if left unspecified will default
to meta
data defined for the entire entity model file. For example the
"description"
element was left out, so the ModelReader will use the description
specified at
the top of the XML file if one exists. The package-name is used to
organize the
entities, and specify a default location for any code that would be
entity
specific. This becomes extremely useful when you have an entity model
with
hundreds of entities.</p>
<p><b>Entity and Field Definitions</b></p>
<p> Notice
that while the field primaryKeyFieldOne has a column name specified,
none of the other
fields do. The col-name and the table-name elements are optional. They
can
be derived from the field name or entity name through widely used
conventions.
These conventions dramatically simplify the definition of entities.</p>
<p>Table and column names are written in caps with underscores
separating the words like
SAMPLE_ENTITY. Entity and field names are written using the Java
conventions for
class and field names where all letters are lowercase except for the
first
letter of each word, which is uppercase. Entity names correspond to
Java classes so the first letter is upper case but field names
correspond to member fields of
a class so the first letter is lower case. For example: SampleEntity
and
fieldOne correspond to SAMPLE_ENTITY and FIELD_ONE.</p>
<p>Multiple primary key columns can be specified using multiple
&lt;prim-key&gt;
tags specifying the names of the primary key fields.</p>
<p>Field types are specified using a type string, which is defined in a
fieldtypemodel XML file specified by the fieldtypemodel.dtd XML Data
Type
Definition. Each type maps to a Java type and an SQL type. Because of
this
separation different fieldtypemodel XML files can be specified for
different
databases allowing an entitymodel XML file to work with the various
databases.
In addition, validators can be specified for a field type or for any
field. This
denotes that the named validator should be called when data is input.
These
validators are defined in the class <b>org.ofbiz.base.util.UtilValidate</b>
and
follow the definition pattern: [<code>boolean isValid(String in);</code>].</p>
<p><b>Entity Relationships (relations)</b></p>
<p>Multiple relationships can exist for each entity. Each relation is
either of type
'one', 'one-nofk', or 'many' depending on the cardinality of the
relation and
whether a foreign key is desired or not. If the type is 'one' or
'one-nofk' then the key-map elements must fully specify the primary key
of
the related entity. If the type is 'many', the key-map elements are not
restricted by the primary key of the related entity.</p>
<p>Foreign keys and indexes on foreign keys can be created
automatically by
the Entity Engine. This is only done for type 'one' relations, not for
'one-nofk' or 'many' type relations.</p>
<p>If multiple relations to the same related entity are used for a
given entity, a title must
be specified to make the relation name unique. By this convention the
relation
name is defined as [title][rel-table-name]. For the two SampleEntity
relations
their names are SelfSampleEntity and AllOneSampleEntity. For
OtherSampleEntity there is no title, so the relation name is simply
OtherSampleEntity, or the name
of the related entity.</p>
<p>Key Maps are used to define how the related entity will be looked
up. Each
key map specified a field name (field-name) and a related field name
(rel-field-name).
If the two column names are the same, the rel-field-name does not have
to be
specified.</p>

<p>In addition to entities that map directly to a single relational
table you can create "virtual" or "view" entities that map to a set of
other entities.
The idea of a <b><code>view-entity</code></b> is the same as the idea
of a view in Oracle, Access, or other popular database management
systems. View Entities allow
you to combine, or join, entities to make a new entity. The new
entity's fields will be aliases of the fields on the original entities.
The member entities of the
view will be linked together by creating a set of view-links that
contain key-maps, just like relationships do as described above.</p>
<p>The meta data for a <b><code>view-entity</code></b> is nearly the
same as for a normal entity. It has a name, package, description,
copyright, author, version, and so forth.
It does not have a table name, since it does not map to a single
relational table in the data source. A view entity must also be
assigned to a group in the
entity group XML file, just like any normal entity. All member-entities
in a
view-entity must be in the same database, but not necessarily in the
same entity

<p><b>Member Entities</b></p>
<p>Normal entities that will become part of the view entity are
referred to as member entities. Each member entity is given an alias
and is referred to by that alias for the rest of the definition. This
allows a single entity to be linked in multiple times.</p>
<p><b>Field Aliases</b></p>
<p>Rather than specifying fields with a view entity you specify
aliases. Each <b><code>alias</code></b> is effectively a field in
usage and is defined
by being mapped to a field on an aliases member entity. If the
<b><code>field</code></b> name is the same as the alias
<b><code>name</code></b>, there is no need to specify it. In
other words if no field name is specified the alias name will be used
as the field name to map to on the member entity with the specified
<b><code>entity-alias</code></b>.</p>
<p><b>View Links</b></p>
<p>View links are used to specify the links between the member-entities
of the view. They link one entity-alias to another and use
key-maps just like relations. Here the field-name specifies the name of
the field on the aliased entity and the rel-field-name the field on
the related aliased entity. As with many other things, the
rel-field-name is optional if it is the same as the field-name.</p>
<p>To represent an outer join you can specify in a <b><code>view-link</code></b>
element that the related entity is optional using the <b><code>rel-optional</code></b>
attribute, which
can be either "true" or "false", and of course defaults to "false". The
Entity
Engine will generate ANSI, Oracle Theta, or MS SQL Server Theta style
join code
depending on the setting in the entityengine.xml file. See the Entity
Engine
Configuration Guide for more information.</p>
<p><b>Primary Keys</b></p>
<p>View Entities have primary keys just like normal entities. The
Entity Engine
automatically determines which aliases are primary keys by looking at
the field
that they alias.</p>
<p>The primary key for a view entity should include all primary key
fields of each
member entity of the view. This means that all of the primary key
fields must be aliased, but fields that are used to link the entities
need only be aliased
once. For example, if an OrderHeader entity has an orderId primary key
and an OrderLine entity has an orderId primary key and an
orderLineSeqId
primary key, and the orderId was the mapped key that links the two
entities, then the view entity would have two primary keys: orderId and
orderLineSeqId. In this case orderId would only be aliased once since
by definition the orderIds from each entity will always be the same
since
that is how the entities are linked (or joined).</p>
<p><b>Relationships</b></p>
<p>Relationships are specified the same way with view entities as they
are with
normal entities. That key-map attributes are still called
field-name and rel-field-name but in the case of view entities the
field name is actually the alias name that will be looked up.</p>
<p><b>Grouping and Summary Data</b></p>
<p>Another useful feature available in a view-entity is the Grouping
and Summary
Data feature. This is accomplished with two attributes on the
<b><code>alias</code></b> element:
<b><code>group-by</code></b> and <b><code>function</code></b>. These
work the
same way conceptually as grouping and functions in SQL.</p>
<p>The <b><code>group-by</code></b> attribute can be set to either
"true" or "false"
and naturally defaults to "false". When set to true the results of a
query will
be grouped by the given aliased field. This means that results where
the aliased
fields with group-by set to true that have equal values will be grouped
together.</p>
<p>The <b><code>function</code></b> attribute is used to summarize
data in a
result group as described in the group-by description above. The values
in the
grouped results will be summarized as specified by the function. The
functions
available include: <b>min | max | sum | avg | count | count-distinct |
upper |
lower</b>. These parallel commonly available functions in SQL.</p>
<p>While it is not required, to keep things simple I recommend querying
only
aliased fields that are either group-by aliases or function aliases.
Also,
remember that not all specified aliased fields may be included in the
list of
fields to retreive in the query because this will over-constrain the
query.</p>
<p>Grouping and summarizing data can be very useful for certain types
of custom
coded reports or for data migration and cleansing.</p>
<p><b>Tips</b></p>
<p>Note that view-entities can get pretty complex in a hurry. Those
familiar
with SQL can look at the generated SQL code to make sure it is doing
what they
intended. For everyone there are a few tips that might be helpful.</p>
<p>First pay attention to ordering of view-links and in some cases
field aliases. In
view-links, except for the first one, make sure the member-entity
referred to in
the entity-alias attribute has been referred to in a previous view-link
(this is
how the link tree is kept clean).</p>

<h3><a name="The_Entity_Engine_API">The Entity Engine API</a></h3>
<hr class="sepbar">
<p>The Entity Engine classes in the package <b>org.ofbiz.entity</b>
define the
API used to interact with Entity Engine entity data. From a users point
of view
only three classes really need to be understood. They are <b>GenericDelegator</b>,
<b>GenericValue</b> and <b>GenericPK</b>. The <b>GenericDelegator</b>
class, usually used with the
instance name '<b>delegator</b>', is used to do <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">create</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">find</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">store</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> </span>and other operations on a
<b>GenericValue</b> object. Once a <b> GenericValue</b> object is
created it will contain a
reference to the delegator that created it and through this reference
it knows how
to store, remove and do other operations without requiring a program to
invoke methods on the delegator
itself.</p>
<p>I've been trying to think of how best to present information about
this API
but short of writing a number of documents about the specific usage of
each
piece there is not much that is useful that I could write here. I
recommend
reading through the JavaDocs for the Entity Engine and other framework
components of OFBiz, and browsing through the various applications in
OFBiz for examples. These heavily use the Entity Engine API.</p>
<p>A few quick notes to help you get started might be in order.</p>
<p><b>Factory Methods</b></p>
<p>Rather than trying to construct a GenericValue or a GenericPK
yourself, you should use the <b>makeValue</b>
and <b>makePK</b> methods on the <b>GenericDelegator</b>. These
create an object
without persisting it and allow you to add to it and create or store it
later
using their own <b>create</b> or <b>store</b> method, or calling the <b>create</b>
or <b>store</b> method on the <b>delegator</b> object.</p>
<p><b>Creating, Storing and Removing</b></p>
<p>To create (or insert) values into the database, use the <b>create</b>
method on the
<b>GenericValue</b> or <b>GenericDelegator</b> objects. To store (or
update) existing values,
use the <b>store</b> method on the <b>GenericValue</b> or <b>GenericDelegator</b>
objects.</p>
<p>For storing multiple entities the <b>GenericDelegator</b> class has
a method
called <b>storeAll</b>. This method takes many
<b>GenericValue</b> instances and stores them in the same transaction.
Actually, to say that
it stores them is incorrect. It checks to see if they exist and if so
does an
update, if not it does an insert. This may be optimized in the future
for speed
by allowing you to specify whether it should be inserted or updated
based on
prior knowledge of the existence of that entity. Note that this is a
DIFFERENT
behavior than the store method, which just does an update.</p>
<p>Removal of entities is done through the <b>remove</b> method on
either the <b>delegator</b>, or the <b>GenericValue</b>.</p>
<p><b>Finding</b></p>
<p>Value instances can be retrieved from the database with the <b>findByPrimaryKey</b>
methods, or a collection can be retrieved using the <b>findAll</b> or <b>findByAnd</b>
methods.</p>
<p>There are two main types of findByAnd methods. Each type has a
number of variations
that may include the use of a cache, and may accept an orderBy field
list. The two
main types accept different field lists. One accepts a Map of fields
and finds entities
by anding together expressions where each named field must equal the
corresponding value
in the map. The other type of findByAnd accepts a list of <b>EntityExpr</b>
objects
that are used to specify small expressions that will be anded together.
Each EntityExpr specifies a field name, an operation, and a value for
the field.</p>
<p><b>The EntityCondition Object</b></p>
<p>Originally the EntityExpr object was meant to be nestable to allow
for
more flexible queries, but was never completed. Also, even if you could
nest it the types of queries you could run would be limited because you
couldn't have two ANDs (for instance) inside a set of parentheses. To
address these issues, and complete the EntityExpr implementation, the
EntityCondition abstract object has been introduced along with the
EntityConditionList and EntityFieldMap objects which both extend
EntityCondition. The EntityExpr object has also been changed to extend
EntityCondition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The EntityConditionList and EntityFieldMap objects are pretty
simple. They
are created with a List or Map, respectively, and an EntityOperator to
specify operator used to join the members of these containers,
generally
AND or OR.</p>
<p>The EntityExpr class now has two primary constructors: one for
comparing
a field to a value (the String, EntityOperator, Object constructor),
and
one for comparing two EntityCondition objects (the EntityCondition,
EntityOperator, EntityCondition constructor).</p>
<p>A findByCondition method is now available that accepts an
EntityCondition argument (as well as some other useful arguments) and
this EntityCondition can be an EntityExpr, EntityConditionList or
EntityFieldMap.</p>
<p>The code inside the Entity Engine has changed somewhat because these
EntityCondition objects now create their own WHERE clauses. This is a
nice architectural point because other custom EntityConditions could
also be created and used as desired by a savvy developer.</p>
<p>On that note a "short cut" implementation of the EntityCondition
abstract
class has been created to incorporate SQL WHERE clause snippets or full
clauses
into the EntityCondition querying framework. The class is named
EntityWhereString and is constructed with a simple String argument that
represents the SQL that will be inserted into the final generated SQL.
This is
not recommended when other options are available, but it necessary for
certain
functionality that the Entity Engine does not otherwise support.</p>
<p><b>The EntityListIterator Object</b></p>
<p>The EntityListIterator class implements the ListIterator interface
for
convenience, but also has other methods that are necessary for its
operation, like a close() method for when you are finished.</p>
<p>This object allows you to iterate through query results efficiently
in
both directions by keeping a reference to the ResultSet that comes back
from the query. This makes it possible to use the cursor feature in the
database and especially for large queries uses memory much more
efficiently. This object constructs GenericValue objects on the fly
rather than creating a bunch all at once, so if you need to export the
results of a huge query to a file or something, it can be done without
a
massive amount of memory.</p>
<p>The EntityListIterator also has helpful methods to get a subset of
the result
set with a start index value and a number of results desired and to get
all of
the results at once rather than having to create a custom loop to do so.</p>
<p><b>The Entity Engine Cache</b></p>
<p>Because the performance cost of retrieving data from a database can
be very
high and can have a serious impact on the overall performance of an
application
or component of an application, the ability to cache data from the
database is
often very important. Many of the find methods on the GenericDelegator
have
corresponding cache methods with the "Cache" suffix on the function
name. This
makes it very easy to cache individual values found by primary key as
well as
value lists found by <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>, or
by <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span>.</p>
<p>The Entity Engine cache uses the OFBiz <b><code>UtilCache</code></b>
class to
implement the actual cache. UtilCache has many features such as limited
cache
size, expiring cache entries after a configurable amount of time, and
soft
references so that the garbage collector can reclaim entries from large
caches when more memory is needed.</p>
<p>There are two ways to configure UtilCache based caches. The first is
to
modify the cache.properties file (as documented in the Core
Configuration Guide)
for permanent changes. The second is to make temporary changes through
the Cache
Management pages in the WebTools webapp. Those pages can also be used
to view
statistics, clear cache values, and perform other cache related
maintenance.</p>
<p>A big issue with this type of cache, where it is not tied directly
to the
database, is clearing "dirty" cache entries. When <span
 style="font-style: italic;">create</span>, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">store </span>or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">remove
</span>operations are done through the Entity Engine, it will normally
be able to
automatically clear any cache entries that might contain the updated
value.
Distributed cache clearing is also implemented and can be configured in
a number
of ways using the flexibility of the Service Engine.</p>
<p>There are some cases where cache entries cannot be automatically
cleared. The
most major issue is with view-entities: when an entity that is
part of a view-entity is updated, it may have only some of the data in
the primary <span style="font-style: italic;">key </span>or
<span style="font-style: italic;">and </span>set that was used to find
and index the cache for that data. There may be a
way to do this automatically, but for now manually clearing view-entity
caches
is still necessary.</p>
<hr class="sepbar">
<h3><a name="JTA_Support">JTA Support</a></h3>
<hr class="sepbar">
<p>The Entity Engine JTA Support is simple to use, but has a few
complications in configuration.
The support runs through an API and a Factory class so that no direct
contact with the
particular JTA implementation is necessary. The TransactionFactory
class can be used to
get the two main objects needed for JTA use: UserTransaction and
TransactionManager. The
current implementation supports the Tyrex JTA/JTS implementation. To
use a different
implementation simply change the TransactionFactory class; everything
else uses that. That's the tricky configuration part, if you aren't
using Tyrex. For Tyrex make sure that a domain
configuration XML file called tyrexdomain.xml is on the running
classpath.</p>
<p>To demarcate transactions you can use the TransactionUtil class.
This class wraps the UserTransaction class and only throws
GenericEntityExceptions and runtime exceptions. The basic methods
needed are begin(), commit(), and rollback(), but the rest are included
and can be very useful. A transaction
is attached to the current thread so it is not necessary to pass it
around all over the place.
After beginning a transaction make sure it is always either committed
or rolled back. This is normally done by committing at the end of a try
block and rolling back in each catch block. You can also use the
standard UserTransaction object by getting one from the
TransactionFactory.</p>

<h3><a name="Core_Web_Tools">Core Web Tools</a></h3>
<hr class="sepbar">
<p>The WebTools web application contains a number of useful tools for
working
with the entity engine. These include a cross linked reference to the
entity
definitions, a tool for editing entity and relation definitions, and a
JSP which
acts as an XML template and also saves the XML entity definitions to
their corresponding files. </p>
<p>There is also a JSP that acts as a front end to the routines which
checks the
current state of the database table definitions and reports any
differences.
Where possible tables or columns that are missing can be added to the
database.
This is the same routine that optionally runs when the server loads and
optionally creates missing tables and columns.</p>
<p>The entity code generator has been removed from the project, or
deprecated if
you will, because of the next generation entity tool which is the
entity engine
described herein. There are still some occasions where the use of
templates to
create entity specific code or other text is useful, and in fact,
necessary. One example of this is the JSP which creates the XML for the
entity
definitions from those definitions, and is used for writing out the XML
after
entity definitions have changed. Other uses for templates include
manually
generating database-specific table creation SQL and quick start JSPs
and event
handlers that allow for finding, viewing and editing entity specific
data.
These can be used as starting points for task specific applications.</p>
<p>Where entity data editing is not task specific, but instead is
entity
specific, the Entity Data Maintenance pages in WebTools can be used.
They are
dynamic pages that rely on the in-memory entity definitions to create
forms for
the entering of data, and events for handing the entered data
(including
validators specified in the entity definition), and finding specific
entities by
any of the fields on the entity, or finding any relation entity
instances for a
given entity instance. For instance, when viewing the OrderHeader
entity all of
the relations to that entity can be viewed as well, including links to
edit and
view them. These related entities would include OrderType (one
relation),
OrderLine (many relation), and many others.</p>
<p>Data in the database can be imported from and exported to Entity
Engine XML files
in the import and export pages. Importing data causes corresponding
entity instances
to either be created or updated, depending on whether or not they
already exist. The
Export page allows you to specify which entities you want to export the
data for by
using a big list of check boxes, one for each entity. For more granular
control over
exported data, the Entity Data Maintenance pages mentioned above would
be the place
to look (not yet finished though...).</p>
