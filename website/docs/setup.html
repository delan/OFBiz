<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This document describes an initial setup process and basic
configuration options
for the Open For Business Project. For more detail see related
documents such
as the OFBiz Framework Configuration Guide, the Entity Engine
Configuration Guide,
the Service Engine Configuration Guide, and other related documents.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Quick_Easy_Setup">Quick &amp; Easy Setup</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>You can get up and running quickly by downloading the OFBiz Complete
distribution and following some simple instructions. For more
options and explanations, see the rest of this document.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download and install the Java 2 v1.4 or later JDK/J2SDK (not the
JRE) from <a href="java.sun.com">Sun's Java site</a>, and make sure
your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to this JDK after
installation</li>
  <li>Download the OFBiz Apps archive and unzip it in the directory of
your choice. This should create one sub-directory: <b>ofbiz</b>. This
will be the OFBIZ_HOME location.</li>
  <li>Start OFBiz with embedded Jetty by going into the <b>ofbiz</b>
directory and then running <b>"startofbiz.bat"</b> (or
"%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java -jar ofbiz.jar") for Windows, or <b>"./startofbiz.sh"</b>
(or "$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar ofbiz.jar") for Linux/Unix.</li>
  <li>Open a browser and go to <b><a
 href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/ecommerce/control/main">http://127.0.0.1:8080/ecommerce</a></b>
for the ecommerce application or <b><a
 href="https://127.0.0.1:8443/webtools/control/main">https://127.0.0.1:8443/webtools</a></b>
for the WebTools application or <b><a
 href="https://127.0.0.1:8443/catalog/control/main">https://127.0.0.1:8443/catalog</a></b>
for the Catalog Manager application.</li>
  <li>The default administrative account is username: "admin",
password: "ofbiz".</li>
  <li>Have fun with it! You are running on a Java database, which isn't
the best for deployment, but it's great for a demo...</li>
  <li>For more detailed options and configuration information, read on!</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="Building">Building From CVS</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>When building from CVS you will need to have Ant (see
http://ant.apache.org) installed and setup properly in addition to a
Java 1.4 or newer J2SDK as mentioned above.</p>
<p>In the directory where you want OFBiz to be, do a CVS checkout of
the ofbiz module on the java.net servers. For example: </p>
<p><code>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:guest@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs login</code></p>
<p>When using the guest account, use an empty password (ie just press
enter when it asks for a password).</p>
<p><code>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:guest@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs co ofbiz</code></p>
<p>For information on connecting to CVS <a
 href="https://ofbiz.dev.java.net/source/browse/ofbiz/" target="_blank">click
here.</a></p>
<p>Now go into the "ofbiz" directory and run "ant". It will compile all
modules and leave you an
executable jar (ofbiz.jar) in the "ofbiz" directory. </p>
<p>To load the seed data, run "ant run-install", or
"$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -jar ofbiz.jar install", or "%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java
-jar ofbiz.jar install"</p>
<p>To start the server run "ant run-install", or "$JAVA_HOME/bin/java
-jar ofbiz.jar",or "%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java -jar ofbiz.jar"</p>
<p>Another build option in the Ant build script that is useful is "ant
clean". That will clean out all built classes allowing you to run "ant"
again to get a clean build.
If you are running into funny errors after updating from CVS in the
future, give this a try first.</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="Database_Setup">Database Setup</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Database setup is done in the entityengine.xml file. There are many
options there which are described in the Entity Engine Configuration
Guide.</p>
<p>The OFBiz Apps archive comes with Hypersonic SQL, a Java database
that
runs in memory. This database is good for demonstration purposes
because it is
easy to setup and use. It is not meant to handle large data sets and
does not
provide the same performance or scalability that a major database would.</p>
<p>There are many open source databases that will scale well and
deliver good performance.
The two most popular are MySQL Max DB (was SAP DB) and PostgreSQL.
Postgres is a very full featured
database with transaction support, foreign keys, stored procedures, et
cetera. Max DB (SAP DB) is another good open source
and it deserves special mention. SAP decided to start making it easier
for users to use commercial databases instead of their own and open
sourced their
database, SAP DB. While maybe not as good in some ways as Oracle or
some other commercial DBs it
has many development and production features and performs very well
with a very complete and advanced feature set.</p>
<p>Commercial databases are also supported. If you have database
licenses for other
needs, or have major in-house familiarity with and support for a
certain commercial
database, then there is no reason not to take advantage of that. OFBiz
has been tested
with Oracle, Sybase, SQL Server and others and should work fine with
any database that has a JDBC driver.</p>
<p>There is no need to run any SQL scripts to create the tables or
populate them
with the default data. The entity engine can create missing tables or
fields
when the server starts up and does so if the appropriate property is
set in the
entityengine.xml file. This is the file that configures the servers for
the
entity engine.</p>
<p>For the table creation routine to work properly, the field types
must be set
up. Do this by specifying the corresponding fieldtypeXXX.xml (where XXX
is the database
name) file for the server in the entityengine.xml file. These
fieldtypeXXX.xml
files are located in the <b>ofbiz/components/entity/fieldtype</b>
directory.</p>
<p>Default data can be loaded automatically once the server has been
started by
going to a JSP, which is described above (ie the install page in
WebTools).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="J2EE_Containers">J2EE Containers</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>OFBiz comes and runs by default with Jetty for a Servlet/JSP
container and
JOTM for a transaction (JTA) manager. A patched version of Minerva
(included in CVS)
is the current preference for a transaction aware connection pool,
though as
other options are made available that may change.</p>
<p>OFBiz can also be configured to run in different containers, but
there may
be issues with certain quirks that other containers have, especially
with
servlet containers. We have always been able to find work-arounds for
these,
but they also seem to keep on appearing, so that is just something to
watch for.</p>
<p>We are not maintaining sample configurations in CVS any more because
it became
too difficult to keep up with changes in new versions for a dozen
different app
servers. We may eventually start this again if there is sufficient
demand and
corresponding contributions. If you are looking for a good commercial
J2EE app
server, Orion is a good place to start, but we recommend trying out
Jetty and JOTM
and see if they meet your needs.</p>
