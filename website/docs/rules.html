<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<hr class='sepbar'>
<p class='contenttext'>The OFBiz Rule Engine is based on logic programming technologies that have existed for
various decades. The most notable logic programming language is Prolog, although others do
exist. Since the invention of Prolog many variations on the theme have appeared, and many
exist now as business rule engines, constraint based optimization engine, etc.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>Some products in the market for Java compatible logic engines and variants include ILOG JRules and various
other rule and constraint technologies (www.ilog.com), Blaze Advisor (www.blazesoft.com) 
and YASU Tech QuickRules (www.yasutech.com). There are also a number of open source and 
research efforts in place, most notable JESS from some guys at the Sandia National Labs. Two
open source projects on SourceForge that deserve mention are under the projects names drools
and info-sapient. Other interesting open source projects include Mandarax, and ...</p>

<p class='contenttext'>The basic idea behind a rule or logic language is that rather than specifying a set
of instructions to run in a certain order like traditional imperative languages you specify
facts and rules. A rule is simply an assertion with preconditions. If all of the preconditions
are met then the assertion is added to the base of known facts, or the knowledge base. A
fact is really just a rule with no preconditions so the assertion is always added to the
knowledge base.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>The ruleset can be used in two different ways: forward chained and backward chained. Backward
chaining is the original way that logic languages, including Prolog, operated. The popularity
of forward chaining has increased over the years and is now more commonly referred to and 
requested than backward chaining. The method of using a ruleset you choose will really depend 
more on what you are trying to do than with the popularity of the options as different 
applications are more suited to one or the other.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>Backward chaining involves a ruleset and a query. The query is the exact opposite of a fact, 
it is a rule with no assertions, just a set of preconditions. When the query is run against the 
ruleset the rule engine simply either proves the query as true or false, or it finds the facts
that satisfy the constraints of the query. This can be very useful for constraint based searching
and facts can be produced one at a time rather than waiting for all possible facts to be produced.
Applying a fitness metric to the resulting facts can help in evaluating the facts and iteratively
searching as long as desired to find better and better results.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>Forward chaining is a completely different way of using a ruleset. Rather than specifying a query
to evaluate you simply run the ruleset against the current knowledge base, allowing it to assert
the facts for each rule has it's preconditions satisfied. This is generally done iteratively until
no rules have all of their preconditions satisfied. In other words, if a new fact is added to the
knowledge base that suddenly makes all of the preconditions of another rule true, then that rule
will also have it's assertion or postcondition added to the knowledge base.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>To make things more interesting, rather than just dealing with the testing and assertion of facts 
integration with other programs can be done through sensors and effectors. This is basicly the process
of specifying a method to call that will produce data when the fact is tested for a sensor, or specifying
a method that will receive data when the fact is asserted for an effector.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>In the current incarnation of the OFBiz Rule Engine only backward chaining is supported.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>On top of the Rule Engine a method is needed of asserting facts and defining rules. If you
are working directly with the API of the Rule Engine then these objects can be added that way.
That can be useful for some circumstances, but would be REALLY tedious if it were the only way
to create facts and rules. A much preferred method is to create a language for specifying facts
and rules in a text file. There are two major types of these languages right now. One type is
a free form language like Prolog (which Logikus is based on) and the other type is using an
XML file. There is a standard in progress for XML rule files called RuleML. Both Logikus and RuleML
are discussed below.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>An introduction to the OFBiz Rule Engine could not be complete without acknowledging the source
of the original code base of the Rule Engine and the Logikus language. Even the name Logikus came
from this source. It is based on the work done for the book Building Parsers in Java by Steven John
Metsker, published by Addison Wesley. Mr. Metsker wrote the license to the code to be very open,
similar to the OFBiz license. He basicly said that you can do whatever you want with it as long
as you don't claim you wrote it. So, I repackaged the code as part of OFBiz and acknowledged him as
the original author of the code and put a dual copyright at the top of each file from the book.
I would like to express thanks here to Steven Metsker for creating an excellent book and a nice
code base that has helped us a lot in getting started. I recomment the book to anyone who plans to
seriously use or extend the OFBiz Rule Engine.</p>

<h3><a name="UIs">Rule Engine UIs</a></h3>
<hr class='sepbar'>
<p class='contenttext'>In addition to using rulesets inside a program they can be run and tested through two user
interfaces that exist as part of the Rule Engine. The first of these is a JSP in the WebTools
webapp that has a textarea for the ruleset and an input box for the query. There is a link to
this page from the main page of the WebTools app.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>The other user interface is a Java Swing application. This looks very similar to the JSP and
can be run with the following command: <code>java -cp $CLASSPATH:ofbcore-rules.jar org.ofbiz.core.rules.LogikusIde</code></p>

<hr class='sepbar'>
<h3><a name="Logikus">Logikus Language</a></h3>
<hr class='sepbar'>
<p class='contenttext'>The Logikus Language is described very well in Steven Metsker's book Building Parsers in Java.
It is based on the Prolog syntax, for those who are familiar with that.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>There have been some changes made to Logikus as part of the OFBiz extensions to the language.
The most notable of these changes is that functors and variables can be upper case or lower case.
String constants must be enclosed in double quotes to differentiate between them and variables. This
is different than traditional Prolog and the original Logikus where a word with a lower case first 
letter is interpreted as a constant instead of a variable name. This change was made to make using 
the language easier on Java developers, or developers familiar with most imperative languages.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>Other changes in the future will include a syntax for specifying that a function corresponds to
an entity from the Entity Engine, and for using sensors and effectors.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>There are many examples of Logikus rulesets and queries in the core/docs/examples/rules directory.</p>

<hr class='sepbar'>
<h3><a name="RuleML">RuleML Language</a></h3>
<hr class='sepbar'>
<p class='contenttext'>RuleML is an XML file type definition for specifying facts and rules. The website for RuleML
contains links to many interesting resources and has some interesting information about rule and logic
languages and their applications. The RuleML website is at 
<a href="http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/ruleml/">http://www.dfki.uni-kl.de/ruleml/</a>.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>An interesting open source project to look at to understand RuleML better is Mandarax. They have a 
RuleML interpreter and a Swing app for editing rules.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>The RuleML interpreter for the OFBiz Rule Engine has not yet been written, but it is planned for.</p>

<hr class='sepbar'>
<h3><a name="API:Logikus">API: Logikus Facade &amp; Engine Classes</a></h3>
<hr class='sepbar'>
<p class='contenttext'>To use Logikus rulesets and queries from your Java applications you can use the LogikusFacade
class which provides some useful methods for parsing and executing rulesets, and then retrieving
and evaluating the results. The full path of the class is org.ofbiz.core.rules.logikus.LogikusFacade.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>I will go through an example in here of parsing a Logikus file to create a Program class, and
parsing a query to make a Query class, and then optionally adding rules or facts to the Program,
and then running the Query against the Program and retrieving the results. This is a backward 
chaining example.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>First, the main packages you will deal with are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>org.ofbiz.core.rules.logikus.*
  <li>org.ofbiz.core.rules.parse.*
  <li>org.ofbiz.core.rules.parse.tokens.*
  <li>org.ofbiz.core.rules.engine.*
</ul>

<p class='contenttext'>Next, create a <code>org.ofbiz.core.rules.engine.Program</code> object from a logikus ruleset
by parsing the text of the ruleset with the following instruction:</p>
<p class='contenttext'><code>Program program = LogikusFacade.program(programText);</code></p>
<p class='contenttext'>Before parsing the query text and creating a Query object you can add other
facts and rules to the program with the following method:</p>
<p class='contenttext'><code>program.addAxiom(axiom);</code></p>

<p class='contenttext'>Both the Fact object and Rule object implement the Axiom interface and can
be added to a program as an axiom. For instructions on how to construct these
objects see the JavaDocs for them. They are both in the <code>org.ofbiz.core.rules.engine</code> package.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>Now you can parse the query text and create a Query object with the following:</p>
<p class='contenttext'><code>Query query = LogikusFacade.query(queryText, program);</code></p>

<p class='contenttext'>Now everything is in place to get the engine running and finding results. The
Query object has a method to get a pointer to the current set of variables that
represent a result to the query. This object will always contain the current
result from the query.</p>
<p class='contenttext'><code>Unification vars = query.variables();</code></p>

<p class='contenttext'>It works like the Enumeration class in that the variables can be used a number 
of times for a single result and the next result will be retrieved when the 
<code>canFindNextProof()</code> method is called, as follows:</p>
<p class='contenttext'><code>boolean moreProofs = query.canFindNextProof();</code></p>
<p class='contenttext'>or, maybe in a bit more useful form:</p>
<p class='contenttext'><code>while (query.canFindNextProof()) {</code></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The individual results can be retrieved from the Unification object if variables
where specified in the query. If no variables where specified in the query the
<code>canFindNextProof()</code> will return true, but the <code>vars.size()</code>
method will return 0. This means that a proof was found, or the query was proved 
to be true, but no variables needed unifying.</p>

<p class='contenttext'>When variables are unified in the result they can be retrieved from the 
Unification with the following code:</p>
<p class='contenttext'><code>Variable var = vars.variableAt(i);</code></p>
<p class='contenttext'>or an enumeration of the variables can be pulled out as follows:</p>
<p class='contenttext'><code>Enumeration varEnum = vars.elements();</code></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Variable and Unification objects have <code>toString()</code> methods
for displaying their values. Other information about them is available in the
JavaDocs.</p>
