<p><b><u>Technology</u></b></p>

<p>The Open For Business Project will be built according to the J2EE specification.
Because of its standards based nature the project will be useable on many different
platforms on many different levels.  Various application servers, servlet engines,
databases, operating systems, and development environments will be supported with
minimal modifications to the project.
</p>

<p>
The application server will initially be JBoss (see <a href="http://www.jboss.org">www.jboss.org</a>).
The Servlet/JSP engine will initially be Tomcat from the Apache Jakarta project (see <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">jakarta.apache.org</a>).
The database will initially be MySQL (see <a href="http://www.mysql.com">www.mysql.com</a>).
The development environment will initially be NetBeans (see <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a>).
No particular operating system will be preferred, although we plan to develop and test on Linux and Windows.
</p>

<p><b><u>Framework</u></b></p>

<p>A major part of the project plan is to create a framework on which business 
applications can be easily and efficiently developed in a J2EE environment.  This 
framework will include tools and components useful for data driven development
as well as process driven development.</p>

<p>The data driven development tools will include a code generator to create Entity EJBs
and everything needed to deploy them (including SQL to create a table and deployment descriptors),
and everything needed to maintain and interact with the data from a web based (JSP/Servlet) client.</p>

<p>The process driven development tools will include a rules engine and a state based
workflow tool.  These tools make the definition and maintenance of business
processes easier and more efficient.  No modern enterprise system would be
complete without them.</p>

<p><b><u>Features</u></b></p>

<p>Our desired feature set is broad.  Our basic guideline for what to include versus
what to not include is centered around whether or not businesses in general need
a given feature.  Industry specific features can be added by adopters in those industries.
Because of this focus, we intend to make it easy to customize this software for
people in any industry and simply provide tools that will be useful in most
vertical industries.</p>

<p>Some of the features that we believe are useful to nearly all business include:
customer, employee, and other person management; catalog and inventory management;
fixed and fluid asset management (including general accounting features); 
transaction management for both sales and purchasing; partner relationship management;
purchasing and sales automation; analysis for marketing and management; 
anything else that comes up during the project that seems generally useful.</p>
