<p><b><u>Technology</u></b></p>

<p>The Open For Business Project will be built according to the J2EE specification.
Because of its standards based nature the project will be useable on many different
platforms on many different levels.  Various application servers, servlet engines,
databases, operating systems, and development environments will be supported with
minimal modifications to the project.
</p>

 <p>Other open source projects are leveraged in various places. Examples of this
 include the Xerces XML library, the Axis Java SOAP tools, and the BeanShell
 Java-like scripting language.
</p>

<p><b><u>Framework</u></b></p>

<p>A major part of the project is a framework on which business 
applications can be easily and efficiently developed in a J2EE environment.  This 
framework will include tools and components useful for data driven development
and process driven development.</p>

 <p>The primary data driven development tool is the Entity Engine which provides
 generic value objects and primary key objects that can be used with a caching
 tool and an API which handles all persistence with NO entity specific code. All
 entities are defined in XML files and changing an entity is as simple as
 changing the XML entity definition, and then modifying corresponding process
 oriented code. This does a lot to enable fast paced iterative development.</p>

<p>The process driven development tools will include a Rules Engine and a
Workflow Engine.  These tools make the definition and maintenance of business
logic and processes easier, more natural, and more efficient than plain Java
code could ever be.  No modern enterprise system would be
complete without them. Another important tool related to process driven
development is the Services Engine. This provides a framework for creating and
using internal services which may also be exposed as web services creating
sharable, reusable and distributable logic. Both rules and workflow invocation
can be done through the Services Engine in addition to Java methods and
BeanShell scripts.</p>

<p><b><u>Application Features</u></b></p>

<p>Our desired feature set is broad.  Our basic guideline for what to include versus
what to not include is centered around whether or not businesses in general need
a given feature. While general features are the first priority optional industry
specific features will be added as the project progresses and interest is
expressed. Because of this focus, we intend to make it easy to customize this software for
people in any industry or market and simply provide tools that will be useful in most
vertical industries.</p>

<p>Some of the features that we believe are useful to nearly all business include:
customer, employee, and other party management; catalog and inventory management;
fixed and fluid asset management (including general accounting features); 
transaction management for both sales and purchasing; partner relationship management;
purchasing and sales automation; analysis for marketing and management; 
anything else that comes up during the project that seems generally useful.</p>
