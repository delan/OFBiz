<h2>The Open For Business Project - General Overview</h2>
</center>
<div class="contenttext">Written By: David E. Jones, <a
 href="mailto:jonesde@ofbiz.org">jonesde@ofbiz.org</a></div>
<div class="contenttext">Last Updated: 02 August 2003</div>
<p class="contenttext"><b><u>Purpose</u></b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Purpose of this document is to give you an
overview of the Open For Business Project from a business perspective.
It will review some of the principles and motivations behind the
project, major application components, and a brief explanation of the
system's technical organization.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The descriptions of functionality in this
document are meant
to give you a high level overview of the system. For more detailed
information you can look over the <a href="feature-list.html">Feature
List</a> and related documents.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
<p class="contenttext">Open For Business (OFBiz) is a suite of
enterprise applications built on a common architecture using common
data, logic and process components. The loosely coupled nature of the
applications makes these components easy to understand, extend and
customize. </p>
<p class="contenttext">The tools and architecture of OFBiz make it easy
to efficiently develop and maintain enterprise applications. This makes
it possible for us as the creators and maintainers of the project to
quickly release new functionality and maintain existing functionality
without extensive effort. It also makes it easy to customize and extend
existing functionality when you have a specific need.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The architecture alone makes it easier for you
to customize the applications to your needs, but many of the best
flexibility points in the system would be meaningless and even
impossible if the system was not distributed as open source software.
OFBiz is licensed under the MIT Open Source License which grants you
the right to customize, extend, modify, repackage, resell, and many
other potential uses of the system. </p>
<p class="contenttext">No restrictions are placed on these activities
because we feel that they are necessary for effective use of this type
of software. Unlike other open source licenses, such as the GPL, your
changes do not have to be released as open source. There are obvious
benefits to contributing certain improvements, fixes and additions back
to the core project, but some changes will involve proprietary or
confidential information that must not be released to the public. For
this reason OFBiz uses the MIT license which does not require this. For
more information on open source licenses see the Open Source Initiative
(OSI) web site at <a href="http://www.opensource.org">www.opensource.org</a>.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Another benefit of this open source model is
that we receive constant feedback from those who are using the
software. We have received countless bug fixes, improvement
suggestions, and best-practice business advice from users and potential
users of OFBiz. Many of the greatest features in the project were
inspired by some comment or suggestion sent to the mailing lists
associated with the project. With dozens of organizations using the
software and probably hundreds of deployed sites using one piece or
another of the project we generally get 20-30 emails each day about the
project.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">To make sure our functionality is timely and
useful we always start by researching public standards and common usage
for any component we are working on. This helps us support and use
common vocabularies and gives us an instant breadth of options and
features that can only be achieved through standards processes and
other group efforts. It also opens doors in the future for flexible
communication with other systems that are built around the same
standards, both inside your organization and in partner or other
organizations.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The applications and application components that
come with the system provide you with a broad and flexible basis that
can be used as-is with the best-practices based designs, or customized
to your own special needs. The applications facilitate management of
everything from parties and products to accounting, customer service
and internal resource and asset management. Which brings us to the next
topic...
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b><u>Major Application Components</u></b></p>
<p class="contenttext">Through collaboration in a large community and
an ongoing development effort OFBiz hopes to include features that
automate every aspect of enterprise information and knowledge. Early in
the development and design of the project we were searching for a good
initial data model to use as a foundation for the system. </p>
<p class="contenttext">We researched other ERP and CRM systems and
looked at various general and system specific books before finding <u>The
Data Model Resource Book, Revised Edition, Volumes 1 and 2</u> by Len
Silverston. After a few weeks of translating the logical data models
described in these books into flexible and normalized physical data
models we had our initial system organization. Since that time the
initial data model has gone through hundreds of revisions and
refinements based on real-life use of the system and compatibility with
dozens of existing public standards. Because of the flexible system
architecture it is easy to make changes to the data model. This is
necessary for the ongoing improvement of the project and makes it easy
for you to make changes that suit your specific needs.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The top level applications and application logic
components are organized in almost the same structure as the data
model. Once the organization of one level of the system is understood
moving to other levels in the system takes very little effort.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The following is a brief overview of the major
functional areas of the system. Many of these have functionality that
exists now and all have data elements defined that cover the needs of
that part of the system. As further functionality is implemented we
continually refine the data model, but all of the major data element
definitions are in place. So, just remember that much, but not all, of
the functionality described here is implemented at this point.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Common Data</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Common Data in the system includes entities
such as Geographic Boundaries, Units of Measure, Status Codes,
Enumerations, and so forth. Most of this data is seed data that is
imported when the system is installed and generally needs very few
changes over time. Geographic boundary and other applicable seed data
is based on ISO and other standards.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Content</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Content entities are used to track data
resources and structure them into general content and knowledge. They
include many concepts such as: a separation of information and
organization allowing a data resource to be used in many content
structures; flexible organization of content including free-from
association in graphs or more constrained organization in trees, lists,
named maps, templates, etc; the specification of meta-data for content
and data resources that can be used to implicitly organize and
explicitly describe the information. Individual pieces of content can
be in various text and binary formats described by standard MIME types
and character encodings.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Once general maintenance tools for this
information are in place more advanced tools such as keyword based,
meta-data based, and intelligent searching or text mining to
automatically create additional structure or meta-data can be used to
enable enterprise wide document and knowledge management.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The Content entities also include information
about Web-based content such as pages and interaction with content
including visits to a site (or application) and information about every
request sent to the site. This is useful for tracking what users are
doing with an application for security, marketing, usability and other
reasons.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Security</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Security entities are used to control access
to various parts of the system and include user login accounts, login
audit data, permission data, and so forth. Additional more restrictive
security is accomplished through the Party entities and the association
of Parties to various other data in specific Roles. For instance one
user might have a Permission to view and modify all Product data where
another user only has permission to view and modify the Product data if
the user is associated as a Merchandiser with a category that the
product is in.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Party</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">A Party can be either a Person, or a group of
Parties. A Party Group could be a company, an organization within the
company, a supplier, a customer, and so forth. Information that
describes Parties or is directly related to Parties is contained in
these entities.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">One type of related data is Contact Mechanisms
such as postal addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, internet
URLs. Another is Roles that the Party acts in such as Customer,
Supplier, Employee, Manager, Merchandiser, etc. Generally a single
party will interact with different parts of the system in many
different roles.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Another type of data that fits into the Party
category is information about communication and agreements between
Parties. This gets into the area of relationship management and also
includes information about issues or trouble tickets that a Party may
have. These entities are used along with the Work Effort entities to
plan and track the research and resolution of such issues.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Product</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Product entities contain information about
products that are for sale or for use within a company. Products can be
goods or services and there are various types of goods including raw
materials, subassemblies and finished goods. Product information
includes descriptive information about the products but is not used for
describing actual instances (where applicable) or physical goods, that
is where Inventory Items come into play. An Inventory Item contains
information about where a particular good is located, the status of the
item, and a serial number for serialized items or quantity on hand and
available to promise amounts for non-serialized inventory.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Products can be organized into Product
Categories. A single product can be a member of multiple categories and
even categories themselves can be children of multiple categories and
can have multiple child categories. Products can also be associated
with one another to designate concepts such as variants, cross-sells,
up-sells, marketing packages, etc.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Categories can be associated with different
Catalogs. A Product Catalog is essentially a starting point for all
information about a particular set of products to be sold. Promotions
and inventory management options are associated with each catalog so
that different sales channels can behave differently even with the same
set of underlying products.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">To flexibly model different types of features
that products often have there are entities for defining types of
features and actual features that can be applied to products. For
instance, you might say that this shirt is a size large and is a blue
colored shirt. Size and color are types of features and large and blue
are actual features applied to the specific shirt product.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Multiple prices can be associated with a single
product, as can multiple costs. Different prices can be specified for
different currencies, different sets of facilities (or stores), and for
different date ranges. </p>
<p class="contenttext">This is a good place to introduce the
wide-spread use of effective dating in OFBiz. There are two fields
commonly used to express effective dates: fromDate and thruDate. In the
product price example the fromDate and thruDate are used to denote that
a price goes into effect on a certain date and at a certain time and
expires at a certain date and time. This can be used to keep a history
of price changes, and to effectively manage temporary promotional
prices.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">In addition to explicitly specifying prices
there are also entities and logic that uses the entities to have rules
about prices. For instance you could create a rule that is in effect
for a certain time period that puts all of the products in a certain
category on sale. Or, you could give special prices to specific
customers or groups of customers with a simple rule.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Order</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Order entities are used to manage
information about sales and purchase orders and information leading up
to an order. For example a request for a specific product or feature
may be submitted by a customer and that would be tracked by the request
entities in the Order package.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The request can be tracked and turned into a
requirement which can be used to create a Work Effort (a task, for
instance; see the Work Effort section below) to be created that will
satisfy the requirement and fulfill the request. Once a requirement is
made a quote can be produced which if accepted by the customer can be
used to create an order. Once an order is fulfilled an invoice can be
created from the order. Invoices are part of the Accounting entity
package described below.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Orders consist of an Order Header and any number
of Order Line Items and Adjustments that describe the detail of the
Order. There are various pieces of information related to an Order that
can be associated with either the header or an individual or multiple
line items of an order. Examples include the shipping destination and
shipping preferences of an order which may be the same for all line
items, or may be different for each one. </p>
<p class="contenttext">Adjustments are used to contain information
about things that change the price of an order that are not actual
goods or services sold or purchased. Examples include taxes, shipping,
discounts, surcharges, and so forth. An adjustment can be either a flat
amount, a flat amount per quantity, or a percentage of the subtotal of
the entire order or the line item it is associated with. Tax and
shipping are handled as special cases and each adjustment can specify
whether or not it should be included in the sub-total for tax and/or
the sub-total for shipping.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Payment preferences can be tracked as an order
is created to automate payment once an invoice is created. This is
especially useful for payment by credit card or other electronic means.
If no payment preferences are specified then a standard invoicing and
billing process can be used.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Facility</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">A Facility is a building or other physical
location. Examples include warehouses, stores, office buildings,
individual rooms in a larger facility, loading docks, et cetera.
Generally a facility will have Contact Mechanisms associated with it
such as a postal address or a phone number.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Facilities can be grouped into Facility Groups
which in turn can be contained in other Facility Groups. Examples of
groups include store chains, districts, regions, and special groups
used for marketing or the pricing of products.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Inventory Items can be associated with a
facility and even a specific location within a facility. Facility
Locations can be tracked and managed independently of the Inventory
Items they contain for easy management of warehouse spaces and easy
location of specific Inventory Items.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Parties can be associated with Facilities to
represent where a person works, which organization controls or operates
the facility, who manages the facility, et cetera.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Shipment</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Shipment entities are used to track incoming
and outgoing shipments and to issue items from inventory or receive
items into inventory.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">A Shipment consists of multiple Shipment Items
each of which, like an Order Item, represents a certain quantity of a
specific Product. When Shipments are received they can be reconciled
with a purchase order and that information is tracked in the Shipment
Receipt entity.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">When an Inventory Item is issued for an outgoing
shipment it is associated with a Pick List that can be prepared from
multiple Shipments to more efficiently route the picking path in the
warehouse or other facility.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Shipment Packages can be created which represent
a single box or shipping unit. A single box can contain multiple
Shipment Items, even items from different Shipments assuming that they
are going to the same destination.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The Shipment Route entities are used to split up
a Shipment's journey into multiple route segments. One route segment
for a Shipment could be a commercial carrier while another could be a
private carrier or a company owned truck.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Accounting</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Accounting entities are organized according
to age old and generally accepted principles such as double-entry
accounting, a General Ledger with hierarchical accounts, journals and
posting of transactions and corresponding entries. The structure is
primary based on the OMG GL standard and the work that was done on an
AR/AP extension of the OMG GL standard. This correlates well with other
standards such as ebXML and OAGIS.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The Accounting entities are structured such that
accounts for multiple organizations can be managed. The multiple
organizations could be multiple companies, or departments or other
organizations within a company. Each Organization can have various GL
Accounts associated with it so that it can operate with its own subset
of the Master Chart of Accounts. Each Organization can also have its
own set of Journals for flexibility, even though the use of Journals
should be as minimal as possible in favor of allowing the system to
automatically create and post transactions based on business events
triggered by standard procedures and documents such as purchase and
sales orders, invoices, inventory transfers, payments, receipts, and so
forth.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">There are also entities in place for budgeting
and the reconciliation of budgets against actual GL Account balances
for a specific fiscal period. Oh yeah, there are also entities used to
track custom Fiscal Periods and other entities to keep summary results
for accounts in specific periods.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Entities to track Fixed Assets are also part of
the Accounting entity package. This includes depreciation information
in addition to maintenance, scheduling of Fixed Assets (along with the
Work Effort entities), and so forth.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Marketing</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Marketing entities are used to track
information about Marketing Campaigns and related information such as
Contact Lists (mailing, email, or calling lists) and Tracking Codes.
Tracking Codes are primarily used in automated systems to keep track of
where a customer came from and can be used for commission purposes in
addition to analyzing the effectiveness of specific Marketing Campaigns
including advertisements, partnerships or affiliations, and so forth.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Work Effort</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">A Work Effort can be one of many things
including a task, project, project phase, to-do item, calendar item, or
even a Workflow or a Workflow Activity.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Workflows are a special case and are managed by
the OFBiz Workflow Engine. A Workflow is essentially a semi-automated
process that involves both automatic activities performed by the
computer and manual activities performed by a human or some other
external system controlled by a human. The Workflow Engine processes
Workflows defined in special entities modeled after the Workflow
Management Coalition (WfMC.org) specifications. XPDL files can be
imported into these entities and then the Workflows defined there can
be invoked through various means. The Workflow Engine keeps track of
everything that has been done and that needs to be done for the
processes that it runs.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">There are also entities in the Work Effort
entity package for keeping track of timesheets and the pay rate of
specific Parties performing Work Efforts. In addition various other
resources can be tracked such as Fixed Assets, Facilities, et cetera.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">When Work Efforts are used for manufacturing or
other modification of Products the Products and Inventory Items
consumed and produced by the specific Work Effort can be tracked.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Human Resources</b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Human Resources entities are used to keep
track of positions, responsibilities, skills, employment, termination,
benefits, training, pay grades and payroll preferences, performance
reviews, resumes and applications, and other Human Resources related
information.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b><u>Architecture and System Organization</u></b></p>
<p class="contenttext">Architecture is really just a fancy word for the
organization and composition of application components. There are many
different "tools" available as part of Java, J2EE and the OFBiz Core
Framework that can be used together to efficiently and effectively
organize data and business logic, to provide interfaces to other
systems, and to create user interfaces for humans to interact with the
system.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Entities and Services</b>
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The most basic components in OFBiz are Entities
and Services. An Entity is a relational data construct that contains
any number of Fields and can be related to other entities. Basic
entities correspond to actual database structures. There is also a type
of entity called a "view-entity" that can be used to create a virtual
entity from other entities to combine sets of fields by joining other
entities together. These constructs can be used to summarize and group
data and in general prepare it for viewing or use in a program.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">In many architectures the data or persistence
layer alone consists of hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of
code that must be maintained
as the system is developed and customized. With the Entity Engine this
is all distilled
into only thousands of lines of XML data definitions that drive an easy
to dynamic API.
Even less-experienced programmers can become productive with this tool
in a few days
and never have to learn any SQL. It takes care of that for you! </p>
<p class="contenttext">You have probably heard some of the "Web
Services" buzz that
has spread to every corner of the software industry. The OFBiz system
not only uses the service pattern to communicate with other systems, it
also uses the service pattern inside the system to provide a clean and
easy to use facility for creating
and running business logic components.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">A Service is a simple process that performs a
specific operation. A service definition is used to define the input
and output parameters that the service consumes and produces. Data
passed to the service can be automatically validated before the actual
logic is called using this definition. After a service is run the
results can be validated in the same way. </p>
<p class="contenttext">Other services can be run automatically at
different points of the running of a service by using
Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules to denote what other services should
be called and under what circumstances. This allows logic to be
extended without modifying the original logic and allows the system to
be organized cleanly such that each service performs one simple,
specific task.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Services can be implemented in a number of
different ways to make it easier for engineers to match the tools
available to the task at hand. It also makes it easy to keep track of
the logic components in the system which may exists in hundred of
different files and even on different computers used inside the company
or computers of a partnering company.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Workflow and Rules</b>
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The Workflow Engine, which is described briefly
in the Work Effort section above, can be used to automate business
processes consisting of both manual (humanly performed) and automatic
(computer performed) activities. Workflows can be called as services
and automated activities within a workflow can call services allowing
unlimited flexibility in combining these small logical components.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">The purpose of workflow tools is to automate and
track
complex business processes. They can help to insure that your policies
are followed
and that important tasks are not lost in the chaos and confusion that
even reasonably sized organizations often operate in. A good example of
this is the Order Manager in OFBiz which is workflow based. When an
order is placed a workflow is started and tracked through approval and
fulfillment of the order. With this tool it is easy to
see what has happened to a specific order and what still needs to be
done with the
order. </p>
<p class="contenttext">There are many other examples of processes that
can benefit by this
sort of management. For example: content creation and publishing,
customer issue, complaint and service management, sales cycle
management, and any other business
process that involves the coordination of different people in different
roles. </p>
<p class="contenttext">The Rule Engine in OFBiz is essentially an
alternative programming language that is based on concepts completely
different from procedural programming languages like Java, Basic, C,
Cobol, and so forth. Facts and rules are declared and then used in one
of two ways: 1) asking if a specific assertion is true and showing all
possible proofs of the assertion, and 2) presenting all information
available and asking the Rule Engine to produce all other information
possible given the facts and rules it knows about.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Rule engines can be used for many different
applications. They are most useful for decision support and helping
humans analyze situations that are too complex to do on paper or in
one's head or by any means because of the amount of time that would be
involved. Using the rules as constraints and finding all valid
solutions to a problems such as airport gate assignments or truck
delivery and pickup routing can save countless hours and allow for
consistent application of rules that a human might occasionally miss or
forget no matter how experienced that person is.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b>Web Framework and XML Mini-Languages</b>
</p>
<p class="contenttext">There are many useful tools in the OFBiz Core
Framework that address points of difficulty in web, client-server and
peer-to-peer based enterprise applications. A tool exists for
simplifying the use of flat data files making it easier to integrate
with legacy systems. Various tools exist for organizing and structuring
web-based content and applications with a flexible separation of logic
and presentation. These tools along with the standard J2EE and other
Java tools make it easy for the system to communicate with human users
and other systems.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">To make it easier to use these Core Framework
tools another component called an XML Mini-Language has been created
that allows an engineer or other user to create an XML file with
simple, well-defined instructions that the system can understand and
execute. Expressing logic in a Mini-Lang "simple-method" often requires
only one third as much code as an equivalent Java method and is much
easier to read and modify for semi-technical users. Processing form
input, composing services into larger services, and interacting with
data in the database are common things that can be done easily with
this tool.
</p>
<p class="contenttext"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>
<p class="contenttext">The Open For Business Project is a collaborative
effort involving a large group of users and developers and is moderated
by a small central team. The applications and framework components are
being used in a wide variety of businesses and applications and are
customized heavily in many circumstances to meet the needs of the
organizations using the software.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">This is only possible and can only operate
efficiently and effectively as an open source project. This is in sharp
contrast to the style of most commercial vendors that restrict many
possible uses of and extensions to their software through design
limitations or licensing restrictions in order to extract a greater
profit from the use of the software. Much of the early commercial
software was much more flexible and open and less restrictive than many
modern packages. As that trend continues more developers and users of
software start to consider a more trusting alternative.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">While those who contribute to the project,
including the moderators, choose not to force others who use it to pay
them, they can benefit in many other ways. Often you will find that the
system is so close to what you need that a small amount of effort on
your part can change the system to be perfect for you. If that effort
is contributed back to the community others in a similar situation can
help improve and maintain it. You as the contributor you can freely
upgrade your own system with other improvements in the main project
without having to worry about your changes that might conflict with his
addition.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">In general OFBiz is meant to provide so much
value that you will be willing and happy to contribute something back
and keep the effort going. This again is in sharp contrast to the
commecial approach of forcing users to pay for every right of use or
modification related to the software. The open source approach enables
information sharing and that information can be leveraged by all in the
community to improve the use of the software for their own needs.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">So, for the moderators of the project, what do
we get for all of the time spent designing frameworks and applications,
writing code, and answering questions? It goes back to the basic law of
the harvest: you reap what you sow. The more value something provides,
the more it is worth. For us it is an opportunity to be at the nexus of
such a project and to be at least somewhat involved in helping it grow.
This gives us the chance to work with you
and provide services in return for revenue that keeps the project
going.
</p>
<p class="contenttext">Our only hope is that you will be able to derive
as much value from the project as we have.
