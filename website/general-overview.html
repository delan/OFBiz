<p class='contenttext'><b><u>Purpose</u></b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Purpose of this document is to give you an overview of the 
Open For Business Project from a business perspective. It will 
review some of the principles and motivations behind the project, major 
application components, and a brief explanation of the system's technical organization.

<p class='contenttext'>The descriptions of functionality in this document are meant
to give you a high level overview of the system. For more detailed information you 
can look over the <a href='feature-list.html'>Feature List</a> and related documents.

<p class='contenttext'><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>Open For Business (OFBiz) is a suite of enterprise applications 
built on a common architecture using common data, logic and process components. The loosely 
coupled nature of the applications makes these components easy to understand, extend and customize. 

<p class='contenttext'>The tools and architecture of OFBiz make it easy to efficiently develop and maintain 
enterprise applications. This makes it possible for us as the creators and maintainers of 
the project to quickly release new functionality and maintain existing functionality without 
extensive effort. It also makes it easy to customize and extend existing functionality when 
you have a specific need.

<p class='contenttext'>The architecture alone makes it easier for you to customize the 
applications to your needs, but many of the best flexibility points in the system 
would be meaningless and even impossible if the system was not distributed as open source 
software. OFBiz is licensed under the MIT Open Source License which grants you the right to 
customize, extend, modify, repackage, resell, and many other potential uses of the system. 

<p class='contenttext'>No restrictions are placed on these activities because we feel 
that they are necessary for effective use of this type of software. Unlike other open 
source licenses, such as the GPL, your changes do not have to be released as open source. 
There are obvious benefits to contributing certain improvements, fixes and additions back 
to the core project, but some changes will involve proprietary or confidential information 
that must not be released to the public. For this reason OFBiz uses the MIT license which does 
not require this. For more information on open source licenses see the Open Source Initiative 
(OSI) web site at <a href='http://www.opensource.org'>www.opensource.org</a>.

<p class='contenttext'>Another benefit of this open source model is that we receive 
constant feedback from those who are using the software. We have received countless bug 
fixes, improvement suggestions, and best-practice business advice from users and potential 
users of OFBiz. Many of the greatest features in the project were inspired by some 
comment or suggestion sent to the mailing lists associated with the project. With dozens of 
organizations using the software and probably hundreds of deployed sites using one 
piece or another of the project we generally get 20-30 emails each day about the project.

<p class='contenttext'>To make sure our functionality is timely and useful we always 
start by researching public standards and common usage for any component we are working on. 
This helps us support and use common vocabularies and gives us an instant breadth of options 
and features that can only be achieved through standards processes and other group efforts. 
It also opens doors in the future for flexible communication with other systems that are 
built around the same standards, both inside your organization and in partner or other organizations.

<p class='contenttext'>The applications and application components that come with 
the system provide you with a broad and flexible basis that can be used as-is with 
the best-practices based designs, or customized to your own special needs. 
The applications facilitate management of everything from parties and 
products to accounting, customer service and internal resource and asset management. 
Which brings us to the next topic...

<p class='contenttext'><b><u>Major Application Components</u></b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>Through collaboration in a large community and an ongoing 
development effort OFBiz hopes to include features that automate every aspect of 
enterprise information and knowledge. Early in the development and design of the 
project we were searching for a good initial data model to use as a foundation 
for the system. 

<p class='contenttext'>We researched other ERP and CRM systems and looked at 
various general and system specific books before finding <u>The Data Model 
Resource Book, Revised Edition, Volumes 1 and 2</u> by Len Silverston. After a 
few weeks of translating the logical data models described in these books into 
flexible and normalized physical data models we had our initial system 
organization. Since that time the initial data model has gone through hundreds 
of revisions and refinements based on real-life use of the system and compatibility 
with dozens of existing public standards. Because of the flexible system 
architecture it is easy to make changes to the data model. This is necessary 
for the ongoing improvement of the project and makes it easy for you to make 
changes that suit your specific needs.

<p class='contenttext'>The top level applications and application logic components 
are organized in almost the same structure as the data model. Once the organization of 
one level of the system is understood moving to other levels in the system takes very 
little effort.

<p class='contenttext'>The following is a brief overview of the major functional 
areas of the system. Many of these have functionality that exists now and all 
have data elements defined that cover the needs of that part of the system. As 
further functionality is implemented we continually refine the data model, but 
all of the major data element definitions are in place. So, just remember that 
much, but not all, of the functionality described here is implemented at this point.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Common Data</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Common Data in the system includes entities such as 
Geographic Boundaries, Units of Measure, Status Codes, Enumerations, and so forth. 
Most of this data is seed data that is imported when the system is installed and 
generally needs very few changes over time. Geographic boundary and other applicable 
seed data is based on ISO and other standards.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Content</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Content entities are used to track data resources and structure them into 
general content and knowledge. They include many concepts such as: a separation 
of information and organization allowing a data resource to be used in many content 
structures; flexible organization of content including free-from association in 
graphs or more constrained organization in trees, lists, named maps, templates, 
etc; the specification of meta-data for content and data resources that can be 
used to implicitly organize and explicitly describe the information. Individual 
pieces of content can be in various text and binary formats described by standard 
MIME types and character encodings.

<p class='contenttext'>Once general maintenance tools for this information are in place more advanced 
tools such as keyword based, meta-data based, and intelligent searching or text 
mining to automatically create additional structure or meta-data can be used to 
enable enterprise wide document and knowledge management.

<p class='contenttext'>The Content entities also include information about Web-based content such as 
pages and interaction with content including visits to a site (or application) and 
information about every request sent to the site. This is useful for tracking what 
users are doing with an application for security, marketing, usability and 
other reasons.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Security</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Security entities are used to control access to various parts of the system 
and include user login accounts, login audit data, permission data, and so forth. 
Additional more restrictive security is accomplished through the Party entities and 
the association of Parties to various other data in specific Roles. For instance one 
user might have a Permission to view and modify all Product data where another user 
only has permission to view and modify the Product data if the user is associated as 
a Merchandiser with a category that the product is in.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Party</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>A Party can be either a Person, or a group of Parties. A Party Group could be a 
company, an organization within the company, a supplier, a customer, and so forth. 
Information that describes Parties or is directly related to Parties is contained 
in these entities.

<p class='contenttext'>One type of related data is Contact Mechanisms such as postal addresses, phone 
numbers, email addresses, internet URLs. Another is Roles that the Party acts in such 
as Customer, Supplier, Employee, Manager, Merchandiser, etc. Generally a single party 
will interact with different parts of the system in many different roles.

<p class='contenttext'>Another type of data that fits into the Party category is information about 
communication and agreements between Parties. This gets into the area of relationship 
management and also includes information about issues or trouble tickets that a Party 
may have. These entities are used along with the Work Effort entities to plan and 
track the research and resolution of such issues.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Product</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Product entities contain information about products that are for sale or 
for use within a company. Products can be goods or services and there are various 
types of goods including raw materials, subassemblies and finished goods. Product 
information includes descriptive information about the products but is not used for 
describing actual instances (where applicable) or physical goods, that is where 
Inventory Items come into play. An Inventory Item contains information about where 
a particular good is located, the status of the item, and a serial number for 
serialized items or quantity on hand and available to promise amounts for 
non-serialized inventory.

<p class='contenttext'>Products can be organized into Product Categories. A single product can be a 
member of multiple categories and even categories themselves can be children of 
multiple categories and can have multiple child categories. Products can also be 
associated with one another to designate concepts such as variants, cross-sells, 
up-sells, marketing packages, etc.

<p class='contenttext'>Categories can be associated with different Catalogs. A Product Catalog is 
essentially a starting point for all information about a particular set of products 
to be sold. Promotions and inventory management options are associated with each 
catalog so that different sales channels can behave differently even with the same 
set of underlying products.

<p class='contenttext'>To flexibly model different types of features that products often have there 
are entities for defining types of features and actual features that can be applied 
to products. For instance, you might say that this shirt is a size large and is a 
blue colored shirt. Size and color are types of features and large and blue are 
actual features applied to the specific shirt product.

<p class='contenttext'>Multiple prices can be associated with a single product, as can multiple costs. 
Different prices can be specified for different currencies, different sets of 
facilities (or stores), and for different date ranges. 

<p class='contenttext'>This is a good place to introduce the wide-spread use of effective dating in 
OFBiz. There are two fields commonly used to express effective dates: fromDate and 
thruDate. In the product price example the fromDate and thruDate are used to denote 
that a price goes into effect on a certain date and at a certain time and expires 
at a certain date and time. This can be used to keep a history of price changes, 
and to effectively manage temporary promotional prices.

<p class='contenttext'>In addition to explicitly specifying prices there are also entities and logic 
that uses the entities to have rules about prices. For instance you could create 
a rule that is in effect for a certain time period that puts all of the products 
in a certain category on sale. Or, you could give special prices to specific 
customers or groups of customers with a simple rule.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Order</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Order entities are used to manage information about sales and purchase 
orders and information leading up to an order. For example a request for a 
specific product or feature may be submitted by a customer and that would be 
tracked by the request entities in the Order package.

<p class='contenttext'>The request can be tracked and turned into a requirement which can be used 
to create a Work Effort (a task, for instance; see the Work Effort section below) 
to be created that will satisfy the requirement and fulfill the request. Once a 
requirement is made a quote can be produced which if accepted by the customer 
can be used to create an order. Once an order is fulfilled an invoice can be 
created from the order. Invoices are part of the Accounting entity package 
described below.

<p class='contenttext'>Orders consist of an Order Header and any number of Order Line 
Items and Adjustments that describe the detail of the Order. There are various 
pieces of information related to an Order that can be associated with either 
the header or an individual or multiple line items of an order. Examples include 
the shipping destination and shipping preferences of an order which may be the 
same for all line items, or may be different for each one. 

<p class='contenttext'>Adjustments are used to contain information about things that change the 
price of an order that are not actual goods or services sold or purchased. 
Examples include taxes, shipping, discounts, surcharges, and so forth. An 
adjustment can be either a flat amount, a flat amount per quantity, or a 
percentage of the subtotal of the entire order or the line item it is associated 
with. Tax and shipping are handled as special cases and each adjustment can 
specify whether or not it should be included in the sub-total for tax and/or 
the sub-total for shipping.

<p class='contenttext'>Payment preferences can be tracked as an order is created to automate 
payment once an invoice is created. This is especially useful for payment by 
credit card or other electronic means. If no payment preferences are specified 
then a standard invoicing and billing process can be used.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Facility</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>A Facility is a building or other physical location. Examples include 
warehouses, stores, office buildings, individual rooms in a larger facility, 
loading docks, et cetera. Generally a facility will have Contact Mechanisms 
associated with it such as a postal address or a phone number.

<p class='contenttext'>Facilities can be grouped into Facility Groups which in turn can be contained 
in other Facility Groups. Examples of groups include store chains, districts, 
regions, and special groups used for marketing or the pricing of products.

<p class='contenttext'>Inventory Items can be associated with a facility and even a specific location 
within a facility. Facility Locations can be tracked and managed independently 
of the Inventory Items they contain for easy management of warehouse spaces and 
easy location of specific Inventory Items.

<p class='contenttext'>Parties can be associated with Facilities to represent where a person works, 
which organization controls or operates the facility, who manages the facility, 
et cetera.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Shipment</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Shipment entities are used to track incoming and outgoing shipments 
and to issue items from inventory or receive items into inventory.

<p class='contenttext'>A Shipment consists of multiple Shipment Items each of which, like an Order 
Item, represents a certain quantity of a specific Product. When Shipments are 
received they can be reconciled with a purchase order and that information is 
tracked in the Shipment Receipt entity.

<p class='contenttext'>When an Inventory Item is issued for an outgoing shipment it is associated 
with a Pick List that can be prepared from multiple Shipments to more efficiently 
route the picking path in the warehouse or other facility.

<p class='contenttext'>Shipment Packages can be created which represent a single box or shipping 
unit. A single box can contain multiple Shipment Items, even items from 
different Shipments assuming that they are going to the same destination.

<p class='contenttext'>The Shipment Route entities are used to split up a Shipment's journey into 
multiple route segments. One route segment for a Shipment could be a commercial 
carrier while another could be a private carrier or a company owned truck.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Accounting</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Accounting entities are organized according to age old and generally 
accepted principles such as double-entry accounting, a General Ledger with 
hierarchical accounts, journals and posting of transactions and corresponding entries. 
The structure is primary based on the OMG GL standard and the work that was 
done on an AR/AP extension of the OMG GL standard. This correlates well with 
other standards such as ebXML and OAGIS.

<p class='contenttext'>The Accounting entities are structured such that accounts for multiple 
organizations can be managed. The multiple organizations could be multiple 
companies, or departments or other organizations within a company. Each 
Organization can have various GL Accounts associated with it so that it can 
operate with its own subset of the Master Chart of Accounts. Each Organization 
can also have its own set of Journals for flexibility, even though the use of 
Journals should be as minimal as possible in favor of allowing the system to 
automatically create and post transactions based on business events triggered 
by standard procedures and documents such as purchase and sales orders, invoices, 
inventory transfers, payments, receipts, and so forth.

<p class='contenttext'>There are also entities in place for budgeting and the reconciliation of 
budgets against actual GL Account balances for a specific fiscal period. Oh 
yeah, there are also entities used to track custom Fiscal Periods and other 
entities to keep summary results for accounts in specific periods.

<p class='contenttext'>Entities to track Fixed Assets are also part of the Accounting entity package. 
This includes depreciation information in addition to maintenance, scheduling 
of Fixed Assets (along with the Work Effort entities), and so forth.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Marketing</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Marketing entities are used to track information about Marketing Campaigns 
and related information such as Contact Lists (mailing, email, or calling lists) 
and Tracking Codes. Tracking Codes are primarily used in automated systems to 
keep track of where a customer came from and can be used for commission purposes 
in addition to analyzing the effectiveness of specific Marketing Campaigns 
including advertisements, partnerships or affiliations, and so forth.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Work Effort</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>A Work Effort can be one of many things including a task, project, project 
phase, to-do item, calendar item, or even a Workflow or a Workflow Activity.

<p class='contenttext'>Workflows are a special case and are managed the OFBiz Workflow Engine. A 
Workflow is essentially a semi-automated process that involves both automatic 
activities performed by the computer and manual activities performed by a human 
or some other external system controlled by a human. The Workflow Engine 
processes Workflows defined in special entities modeled after the Workflow 
Management Coalition (WfMC.org) specifications. XPDL files can be imported 
into these entities and then the Workflows defined there can be invoked through 
various means. The Workflow Engine keeps track of everything that has been done 
and that needs to be done for the processes that it runs.

<p class='contenttext'>There are also entities in the Work Effort entity package for keeping track 
of timesheets and the pay rate of specific Parties performing Work Efforts. In 
addition various other resources can be tracked such as Fixed Assets, 
Facilities, et cetera.

<p class='contenttext'>When Work Efforts are used for manufacturing or other modification of 
Products the Products and Inventory Items consumed and produced by the 
specific Work Effort can be tracked.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Human Resources</b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Human Resources entities are used to keep track of positions, 
responsibilities, skills, employment, termination, benefits, training, pay 
grades and payroll preferences, performance reviews, resumes and applications, 
and other Human Resources related information.


<p class='contenttext'><b><u>Architecture and System Organization</u></b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>Architecture is really just a fancy word for the organization and 
composition of application components. There are many different "tools" 
available as part of Java, J2EE and the OFBiz Core Framework that can be 
used together to efficiently and effectively organize data and business 
logic, to provide interfaces to other systems, and to create user 
interfaces for humans to interact with the system.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Entities and Services</b>

<p class='contenttext'>The most basic components in OFBiz are Entities and Services. An Entity 
is a relational data construct that contains any number of Fields and can be 
related to other entities. Basic entities correspond to actual 
database structures. There is also a type of entity called a "view-entity" 
that can be used to create a virtual entity from other entities to combine sets 
of fields by joining other entities together. These constructs can be used to 
summarize and group data and in general prepare it for viewing or use in a program.

<p class='contenttext'>In many architecture the data or persistence layer alone 
consists of hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code that must be maintained
as the system is developed and customized. With the Entity Engine this is all distilled
into only thousands of lines of XML data definitions that drive an easy to dynamic API.
Even less-experienced programmers can become productive with this tool in a few days
and never have to learn any SQL. It takes care of that for you! 

<p class='contenttext'>You have probably heard some of the "Web Services" buzz that
has spread to every corner of the software industry. The OFBiz system not only uses 
the service pattern to communicate with other systems, it also uses the service 
pattern inside the system to provide a clean and easy to use facility for creating
and running business logic components.

<p class='contenttext'>A Service is a simple process that performs a specific 
operation. A service definition is used to define the input and output parameters 
that the service consumes and produces. Data passed to the service can be 
automatically validated before the actual logic is called using this definition. 
After a service is run the results can be validated in the same way. 

<p class='contenttext'>Other services can be run automatically at different points of the running of a service by using 
Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules to denote what other services should be 
called and under what circumstances. This allows logic to be extended without 
modifying the original logic and allows the system to be organized cleanly such 
that each service performs one simple, specific task.

<p class='contenttext'>Services can be implemented in a number of different ways to make it easier 
for engineers to match the tools available to the task at hand. It also makes it 
easy to keep track of the logic components in the system which may exists in 
hundred of different files and even on different computers used inside the 
company or computers of a partnering company.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Workflow and Rules</b>

<p class='contenttext'>The Workflow Engine, which is described briefly in the 
Work Effort section above, can be used to automate business processes consisting 
of both manual (human performed) and automatic (computer performed) activities. 
Workflows can be called as services and automated activities within a workflow 
can call services allowing unlimited flexibility in combining these small 
logical components.

<p class='contenttext'>The purpose of workflow tools is to automate and track
complex business processes. They can help to insure that your policies are followed
and that important tasks are not lost in the chaos and confusion that even reasonably 
sized organizations often operate in. A good example of this is the Order Manager in 
OFBiz which is workflow based. When an order is placed a workflow is started and 
tracked through approval and fulfillment of the order. With this tool it is easy to
see what has happened to a specific order a what still needs to be done with the
order. 

<p class='contenttext'>There are many other examples of processes that can be benefitted by this
sort of management. For example: content creation and publishing, customer issue, 
complaint and service management, sales cycle management, and any other business
process that involves the coordination of different people in different roles.    

<p class='contenttext'>The Rule Engine in OFBiz is essentially an alternative programming language 
that is based on concepts completely different from procedural programming 
languages like Java, Basic, C, Cobol, and so forth. Facts and rules are declared 
and then used in one of two ways: 1) asking if a specific assertion is true and showing 
all possible proofs of the assertion, and 2) presenting all information available and 
asking the Rule Engine to produce all other information possible given the facts 
and rules it knows about.

<p class='contenttext'>Rule engines can be used for many different 
applications. They are most useful for decision support and helping humans 
analyze situations that are too complex to do on paper or in one's head or 
by any means because of the amount of time that would be involved. Using the 
rules as constraints and finding all valid solutions to a problems such as 
airport gate assignments or truck delivery and pickup routing can save 
countless hours and allow for consistent application of rules that a human 
might occasionally miss or forget no matter how experienced that person is.

<p class='contenttext'><b>Web Framework and XML Mini-Languages</b>

<p class='contenttext'>There are many useful tools in the OFBiz Core Framework that address 
points of difficulty in web, client-server and peer-to-peer based 
enterprise applications. A tool exists for simplifying the use of flat data 
files making it easier to integrate with legacy systems. Various tools exist 
for organizing and structuring web-based content and applications with a 
flexible separation of logic and presentation. These tools along with the 
standard J2EE and other Java tools make it easy for the system to communicate 
with human users and other systems.

<p class='contenttext'>To make it easier to use these Core Framework tools 
another component called an XML Mini-Language has been created that allows an 
engineer or other user to create an XML file with simple, well-defined instructions 
that the system can understand and execute. Expressing logic in a Mini-Lang "simple-method" 
often requires only one third as much code as an equivalent Java method and is much 
easier to read and modify for semi-technical users. Processing form input, 
composing services into larger services, and interacting with data in the 
database are common things that can be done easily with this tool.

<p class='contenttext'><b><u>Conclusion</u></b></p>

<p class='contenttext'>The Open For Business Project is a collaborative effort 
involving a large group of users and developers and is moderated by a small 
central team. The applications and framework components 
are being used in a wide variety of businesses and applications and are 
customized heavily in many circumstances to meet the needs of the organizations 
using the software.

<p class='contenttext'>This is only possible and can only operate efficiently 
and effectively as an open source project. This is in sharp contrast to the 
style of most commercial vendors that restrict many possible uses of and 
extensions to their software through design limitations or licensing 
restrictions in order to extract a greater profit from the use of the software. 
Much of the early commercial software was much more flexible and open and 
less restrictive than many modern packages. As that trend continues more 
developers and users of software start to consider a more trusting alternative.

<p class='contenttext'>While those who contribute to the project, including the 
moderators, choose not to force others who use it to pay them, they can benefit 
in many other ways. Often you will find that the system is so close to what you 
need that a small amount of effort on your part can change the system to be 
perfect for you. If that effort is contributed back to the community others in 
a similar situation can help improve and maintain it. You as the contributor 
you can freely upgrade your own system with other improvements in the main 
project without having to worry about your changes that might conflict with his addition.

<p class='contenttext'>In general OFBiz is meant to provide so much value that 
you will be willing and happy to contribute something back and keep the effort 
going. This again is in sharp contrast to the commecial approach of forcing users 
to pay for every right of use or modification related to the software. The open 
source approach enables information sharing and that information can be leveraged 
by all in the community to improve the use of the software for their own needs.

<p class='contenttext'>So, for the moderators of the project, what do we get for all 
of the time spent designing frameworks and applications, writing code, and answering 
questions? It goes back to the basic law of the harvest: you reap 
what you sow. The more value something provides, the more it is worth. For us 
it is an opportunity to be at the nexus of such a project and to be at least 
somewhat involved in helping it grow. This gives us the chance to work with you
and provide services in return for revenue that keeps the project going.

<p class='contenttext'>Our only hope is that you will be able to derive as much 
value from the project as we have.
