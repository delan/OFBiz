<p class="contenttext">The purpose of this document and the Jira issue tracking system that goes with it is to help keep users of OFBiz informed 
about the near term directions that are planned for the project. In some cases you may see 
planned timelines for specific pieces of functionality. In general the presense of a feature 
or idea in these resources does not guarantee that it will be implemented, and the exclusion of
a feature or idea from this document does not mean that it will not be implemented.</p>

<p class="contenttext">There are many factors that are taken into consideration when deciding 
what will be implemented next in Open For Business. The strongest factor that decides what will 
be implemented and when is sponsorship for a specific feature. If we have a client that is willing
to pay for certain functionality and who doesn't mind it becoming part of the open source project
it will most likely happen. While major components are rarely started this way, most of the 
features in OFBiz are the result of user sponsorship.</p>

<p class="contenttext">The next strongest factor is contributions and issues from the community.
As a core team of moderators we try to reasonably evaluate all contributions and incorporate the
ones that truly enhance the project. Some contributions require heavy modification and sometimes
bug fixes before we can include them in the project. In general it takes time to evaluate and
incorporate contributions, so we appreciate your patience with this and we thank you for your
willingness to contribute to OFBiz. We also try to resolve issues that are brought up by
the community as quickly as possible. While some issues fall outside the scope of the project
or are really feature requests that may take a great deal of time to implement, most issues 
brought up are resolved quickly.. We have received hundreds of contributions and
issues from the community and they have resulted in countless improvements to the project.</p>

<p class="contenttext">The third strongest factor is functionality that the core team is interested
in developing. As we have free time we do what we can to improve the architecture and tools that
are used in the project, and we expand the applications to try to fill in major gaps. In some cases
this has been the strongest factor given that it is how OFBiz and most of the major modules in the 
project got started and it is how major new modules and components are generally introduced.</p>

<p class="contenttext">The fourth factor that influences our decision of what to implement next 
is feature requests from users or even non-users of the project. While many of these requests are
elevated because of higher priority factors, these requests often get very little attention. Of 
course, if a feature request comes in for something that we already think is important it will
increase the chance of that getting done in the near future. While we do want to try to help 
members of the community, we have limited design and development resources so we have to be 
somewhat careful about where we use them.</p>

<p class="contenttext">OFBiz uses the Jira issue and development management system to keep track
of things that are happening, that have happened, and that will be happening in the project.
If you would like to see what is going on, or would like to participate and contribute to OFBiz
this tool will help you do that.</p>

<p class="contenttext">Now that you are excited about it and interested in it, you can access the <a href="http://jira.ofbiz.org">OFBiz Jira Server at http://jira.ofbiz.org</a>.

<!--
<p class="contenttext">This is an area of interest for many users and potential users of OFBiz. 
To date there hasn't been a lot of sponsorship for this functionality, but it may happen soon anyway
because of the high level of interest in it and the growing number of potential contributors.</p>

<h3><a name="Content">Content Management - Notes updated Feb 2004</a></h3>
<hr class="sepbar"/>

<p class="contenttext">The Content Management portion of OFBiz is one of the big next things 
coming. The generic content structures are suitable for both content and knowledge management
and for content used in many different ways. Some uses include public/private/internet/intranet
published materials, dynamic or aggregated content similar to concepts in software such as wiki,
blogs, forums/threaded discussions, and combinations of these. In addition there will be 
facilities for template controlled content such as legal forms, surveys, etc.</p>

<p class="contenttext">Please note that there are many different ideas about what content 
management should include, and this information will change as time goes on and ideas are better
nailed down.</p>


<ul>
  <li class="contenttext">Role &amp; Task oriented special UIs for simpler management
  <li class="contenttext">Add transform to create links &amp; other tools to handle site 
    structure for managed content, including expanding tree widget kind of like the 
    ProductCategory browser; would use hierarchical ContentAssocs for the data structure
  <li class="contenttext">Wiki style permissions for community content site (like blogs, forums, etc; just different permissions)
  <li class="contenttext">Add versioning to the data resource entities so that previous revisions can 
  be maintained (planning on using a simple mechanism when revision control is 
  desired and a certain resource is updated the old data will be put into 
  another data resource and the original will be updated with the new data and 
  will point to the now old data; ie clone resource, give new id, set id for 
  new resource as the previous version on the current resource, update the data 
  of the current resource; that way all content refering to a resource will get 
  the new content, but it will still be possible to roll-back to previous 
  versions; the other options would be construct a new content structure that 
  will be published when finished so that the current stuff remains untouched 
  until all of the new stuff is in place)
  <li class="contenttext">Incorporate Lucene for text based searching of content
  <li class="contenttext">Meta-data base parametric searching of content
  <li class="contenttext">Searching for content related to products (including relationships with Product, ProductCategory, ProductFeature)
  <li class="contenttext">Custom set of pages for public and private forums. These are 
  ad-hoc administered (with optional permissions) and (with optional permissions) browsed 
  content organized in threads or topics. The 
  content entities will probably work fine for these and it will allow them to 
  use existing features such as searching and templating.
  <li class="contenttext">Add workflow managed content creation features so that when content is 
  created or updated a workflow can be started to manage editing, approval, publishing, etc.
  <li class="contenttext">Create content constrained by templates, or more specifically document
  definitions like DTDs or XML Schemas. The document definition will be a piece of content and
  may have a workflow associated with it that is automatically started when content based on that
  doc type is created/updated/etc.
  <li class="contenttext">Web accessible mailing lists; basically a forum with email distribution &amp; posting of messages/replies through email
</ul>
