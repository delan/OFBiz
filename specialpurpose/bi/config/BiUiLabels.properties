BusinessIntelligenceNote1=This is a proof of concept for an OFBiz integrated framework for business intelligence analysis.
BusinessIntelligenceNote2=The idea is to define a set entities for business intelligence analysis in a separate (olap) database,
BusinessIntelligenceNote3=accessible, in the same way as the main one (oltp), via the delegator.
BusinessIntelligenceNote4=The new olap database, will contain all the entities necessary to datawarehouse analysis:
BusinessIntelligenceNote5=dimensions, facts and star schemas (that are view-entities).
BusinessIntelligenceNote6=The dimensions, facts and star schemas are defined according to best practices for datawarehouses
BusinessIntelligenceNote7=and best practices for OFBiz: they are defined as standard entities using the xml entity defs;
BusinessIntelligenceNote8=clear and consistent naming conventions are used and they are documented
BusinessIntelligenceNote9=by meta data descriptions (in the entity def).
BusinessIntelligenceNote10=The best practices for datawarehouses are mainly taken from the great book "The Data Warehouse Toolkit - Second Edition" by Ralph Kimball.
BusinessIntelligenceNote11=The data for dimensions and facts are maintained and kept up to date using standard OFBiz services
BusinessIntelligenceNote12=(most of them written in minilang to facilitate customizations) and eca rules (easily customizable).
BusinessIntelligenceNote13=The main low level services to post data to the datawarehouse,
BusinessIntelligenceNote14=to map the operational keys with the datawarehouse ones, and to manage
BusinessIntelligenceNote15=history of data changes are already implemented; they will be improved as the datawarehouse will grow (e.g. performance enhancements).
BusinessIntelligenceNote16=The following dimensions (and data services) are defined: CurrencyDimension, DateDimension, ProductDimension;
BusinessIntelligenceNote17=we will have to complete them and design the other ones (the total number of dimension will be probably around 20).
BusinessIntelligenceNote18=Just one fact and one star schema are defined: SalesInvoiceItemFact and SalesInvoiceItemStarSchema.
BusinessIntelligenceNote19=You can quickly initialize the datawarehouse by clicking on the link below:
BusinessIntelligenceNote20=The CurrencyDimension, DateDimension, ProductDimension and the SalesInvoiceItemFact entities will be automatically populated.
BusinessIntelligenceNote21=Then you can run the analysis using the report builder menu.
BusinessIntelligenceNote22=The report builder is a very simple tool that allows you to run
BusinessIntelligenceNote23=the analysis on all the star schemas defined in the system.
BusinessIntelligenceNote24=However, right now there is just one star schema defined:
BusinessIntelligenceNote25=SalesInvoiceItemStarSchema that is a simple "profit and loss" (P&amp;L) analysis.
BusinessIntelligenceNote26=Just select using the checkboxes the fields (columns) you want to see in the report
BusinessIntelligenceNote27=and a simple report will be shown: according to the columns selected the data will be aggregated (drill up/down);
BusinessIntelligenceNote28=all the descriptions you see in the report screens are pulled from the entity definitions.
BusinessIntelligenceNote29=The initialization is needed only once, because the product data and sales invoice data
BusinessIntelligenceNote30=are kept updated by ecas: if you create/update a product or create a new invoice,
BusinessIntelligenceNote31=the new information will be immediately included in the datawarehouse analysis.
