This directory contains the binaries for DataVision by Jim Menard. 

They are used in OFBiz and can be executed from here using the .bat or .sh files.

For a complete copy of DataVision, including source code and documentation, 
goto sf.net/projects/datavision or datavision.sf.net.

If you are using DataVision with OFBiz, I'm sure Jim would appreciate hearing about it.

Later,
-David Jones
