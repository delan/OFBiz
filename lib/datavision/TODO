    Bugs
================================================================

* Edit database connection. Click "OK" to save (without making any
  changes). Run report. java.sql.SQLException: ERROR: Table name "jobs"
  specified more than once.

* Swing layout engine eating up memory, even between reports. "Using -in
  the above application jws- the swing layout on different reports after
  some time I get a java.lang.OutOfMemory exception. I tried gc, weak
  referencing etc but nothing works? Can you help?" Kleandros
  Stogiannopoulos, <kstogian@logicdis.gr>

* What happens when you remove a field that has subtotals? See
  Report.getSubtotalFieldsFor().

* Paste problems:

    ** Paste command, when executed, doesn't get put on menu.

    ** When try to drag pasted field, WIERD things happen.

    ** PasteCommand must handle FPLeafInfo objects, too.

    ** PasteCommand must store type of section so paste can paste into
      proper section between reports.

    ** FP window enable/disable cut, copy, paste.

    ** Pasting into another report does not work because the field wants to
       plop itself down in the same section. I need to put in the same
       *logical* section.

    ** Pasting needs to re-fit sections (and on undo, un-re-fit them).

* When run command in field picker, what should happen to undo/redo?

* HTML layout engine doesn't handle vertical placement of fields within a
  section. For example, in postgresql.xml the date is under the report
  title. When output as HTML, the date is to the right of the title.

* If you close a report while editing a text field, the edit is not
  enforced. Capture the dispose? I think that ignoreKeys will be true.

* All dialog boxes must be prevented from opening multiple instances for a
  single design window.

* Why does the window beep when I hit the delete key?

* LaTeX:

-- LaTeX page footer bug: no page number on A4 paper when the LaTeX is run
   through pdflatex (the data is there in the LaTeX file). Output has one
   more row and footer off of bottom of paper. When run pdflatex, PDF
   MediaBox for both US Letter and A4 has same size (but it's A4 size!).

-- Underline always at same height (currently gets pushed down by '#' in
   'Job #') (use baseline?)

-- Limit text to box

================================================================
    To Do 
================================================================

* Documentation: all h3 tags should have X.Y.Z numbers and appear in the
  TOC.

* Disable "Delete Selected" button from join dialog when there are no
  entries in the list.

* I'd like to see each parameter object have a isSet flag in it. isSet
  would default to false, then when Parameter.setValue() gets called isSet
  is made true. Then when Report.runReport() is called if all the
  Parameters have isSet == true then it doesn't run askForParameters(). --

* Info for sections: height, number of fields.

* Warning if section height totals (page headers plus details, at least)
  are greater than page height.

* Translations

  * tu_TR (Turkish, Turkey) from Ismail Cansiz <icansiz@haysoft.com>
  * Chinese from Liangw <liangw-tek@21.com>
  * Possible Dutch from Nils Ottevanger <N.Ottevanger@hetnet.nl>

  * -q flag translation received for 0.6.0:
	de_DE
	it_ID

  * language updates received for 0.6.0:
	de_DE
	es_MX
	it_IT
	pt_BR
	ru_RU

  * language updates received for 0.5.5:
	bg_BG
	de_DE
	es_MX
	it_IT
	ru_RU

* Add getValue() to all things (columns) for which we now call
  report.columnValue().

* PDF layout engine:
    * Underline
    * Images
    * Borders
    * Lines

* XML data source. "row-end-tag" attribute defines end of detail row. Do we
  need a new column attribute that defines an xml element attribute that
  use used as part of the column name? For example, the XML fragment

    <my-col name="col1">value one</my-col>
    <my-col name="col2">123</my-col>

  couldn't distinguish between what are two different columns. How about
  <column name="my-col" name-attr="name" />?

* Need a way to bind different shortcut and accel keys to menu items.

* Let text column fields expand based on data.

* Even/odd page distinction (sections print even only/odd only/both). Idea
  by Oleg <oleg_vn@users.sourceforge.net>.

* Allow user columns for group values. Zed A. Shaw <zed.shaw@ubc.ca>. Make
  column a Value object. Note: can't add anything else (formula, etc.)
  because (a) only user cols are guaranteed to have their values defined
  and (b) we can't sort by any of the others anyway.

* Optionally repeat group header at top of every page (dinesh).

* If a usercolumn uses a COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX one have to do a GROUP BY on
  all the columns used. I have to a check to see if a usercolumn uses
  the above and automatically adds the GROUP BY before the ORDER BY.

* Web interface for translation submission.

* Updated fr_FR translations.

* Add "quit" to file menu of swing le when it is running standalone.

* Field background color.

* Dragging table into report drags all columns.

* Arrow keys "nudge" selected fields. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Status bar: basic format and position of selected item. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Style gallery; saves space in XML and makes user's formatting easier.
  (Can already use shift-select; applies to all fields.) Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Cut/Paste Format menu item. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Add "hidden" field attribute to format window and format menu. Peter
  Ciuffetti <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Dragging fields: stay within confines of page. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* When opening app with no file, ask to open file instead of assuming new
  report wanted. Peter Ciuffetti <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Most recent files opened list. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* GUI take paper margins into consideration (grey them? make section
  smaller?) Eddie Carpenter <ecarpenter@itex.co.za>

* Display field types (perhaps in popup). This will require bringing back
  Column's typeString instance variable, which was commented out to reduce
  memory requirements. (Tony)

* Commands

  -- create/delete parameter/formula/user col

* Carlos suggests a record number within groups. Problem: if you have two
  groups and you insert a "rec # in group" special field, how will you know
  which group's count is being displayed?

* Remove code in images that turns file paths into URL. As of version
  0.6.0, we only use URLs and change file paths into "file:" URLs.

* Paste into drag targets (code windows, report).

* Lazily instantiate tables and their columns.

* Add copyright to source files.

* New duplicate command? Necessary?

* Persistent undo/redo between application runs.

* User column tests.

* Idea: use formula to present text interspersed with column data.

* All layout engines: take file object instead of writer?

* Allow creation images using any file. That way, eps, tiff, and png files
  can be included in HTML or LaTeX exports, for example. Display an icon
  representing the image.

* Binary data: see if can convert into a string?

* Page borders.

* Cache images so we don't load the same image page after page.

* Support line and border color in layout engines.

* A user requests, "I would love to be able to print labels using this.
  Columns would need column spacing and row spacing. I would not care about
  the direction of the columns, left to right, or top to down."

* Different color (e.g., red) if number is negative.

* JFreeChart integration?

* Comments in PaperFormat.java.

* Comments in SortedListModel.java.

* Comments in new Swing classes.

* When placing a text widget, let ESC key cancel operation.

* Turn "http:", "ftp:" etc. into hyperlinks in HTML and DocBook layout
  engines. How about XML and LaTeX (use htlink command)? David Jones
  <jonesde@ofbiz.org>

* Test for non-null format when field created by being dragged. (really
  default format not containing null color).

* On OS X, Command-Q quits app with no chance of saving report. Is there
  any way of trapping that?

* Allow column names (not table.column) in editor windows, but only if the
  name is (a) unique across all tables and (b) not an otherwise reserved
  word.

* Separate XML file for database connection info (perhaps via a URL)? That
  way the report can be distributed to separate users or used with separate
  database instances.

* New layout engine classes from Adeline and Edison. Add them to Credits.
  LE is not different, except for creation of page, use of TextField, and
  page.addTextField().
  Page has new setMargin(), setPage(), and addTextField() methods. Page
  holds list of fields and iterates over them to paint instead of adding
  them to the swing page. See print(), paintComponent(), and doPaint().

* Keyboard navigation and defaults for dialogs.

* In the field picker window, visually mark formulas and parameters used in
  the report.

* Add more screenshots. One with everything open?

* Pop-up list of example driver names and connection strings? Suggestion
  from Guido Amoruso <guidonte@libero.it>.

* Send email to swing-feedback@java.sun.com. See
  http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/sightings/.

* Allow subtotaling of time intervals.

* Add printout and export examples to Web site.

* Access to SQL functions like SUM, AVG. New field type?

* Cataloging/searching reports (XML files).

* Arrow keys nudge selected fields a pixel at a time.

* When trying to log in, notify user of error messages. Perhaps quit after
  three or five times instead of looping indefinitely.

* Let user open connection info dialog from login dialog.

* Make formats easier to use. Don't require user to understand
  SimpleDateFormat and DecimalFormat.

* Can we use SQL error number or message to determine if we want to retry a
  botched login? How was it botched: bad password or something else?

* Docs: testdata directory.

* FAQ:

-- classpath error messages

-- mailing lists

* Avoid circular references in formulas.

* Need another way to open field picker window besides the "Insert" menu.

* Joins should support inner and outer joins.

* Let user enable/disable ErrorHandler's stack trace printing.

* In db conn info window, disable OK and Apply buttons until both class
  name and conn info are supplied.

* Save last used directory of file open widget.

* Save layout engine type in report for use as default next time?

* Let report run window use same code as design window to export report.

* Factor out common code in GroupWin and SortWin?

* "Are you sure?" when exporting over an existing file.

* CharSepLE: make quotes around fields optional, at least for fields that
  don't contain quotes or separator characters.

* Display borders in Swing layout. Problem: borders in LaTeX are outside
  the bounds, borders in Swing are much easier to implement inside the bounds.

* Shortcut keys for buttons like Yes/No/Cancel and OK/Apply/Revert/Cancel.

* Reduce coupling (Demeter principle).

* Complete javadoc comments.

* VisTableWin: only enable Delete Selected button when some join's delete
  check box is selected.

* Save window positions and sizes. Save info in report XML?

* Visual join editor (tables are visual; drag arrows between columns to
  create joins).

* Formula parser checks syntax and types.

* Strings into props file for future I18N.

* Command line opt for alternate string props file.

* Multiple sections moot since no suppression proces yet.

* Dynamically load LayoutEngine subclasses. Allows for dynamic extension.

* Use XQL?

* Use XSchema instead of DTD?

* Select fields by clicking and dragging a selection box with the mouse.
  (Can already use shift-select, of course.)

* Field picker toolbar: create, delete, edit.

* Use Action objects for actions common to menu and popup? The problem is
  that some shared actions aren't really identical when invoked from the
  window menu and from a field (the popup in the field).

* Stored procedures.

* Icons for field picker win.

* Grid toggle for window. When moving or putting down (drag and drop)
  fields, snap to grid. Menu item in Format menu.

* Can add action listener to an entire menu instead of just one item at a 
  time.

* Use a Menu Listener!! That way we can enable/disable menus in dialog 
  window without resorting to calling enable after every select.
  (See JMenu addMenuListener)

* Logo for DataVision.

* Image for dragging fields (use Field.DEFAULT_WIDTH and
  Field.DEFAULT_HEIGHT).

* Design window toolbar (make it optional).

* Suggestions from Tony: combos, areas, checkbox, background, working
  borders, line, rectangles.

* Add if-then-else and booleans to formula expressions: &, |, &&, ||, <, >,
  <=, >=, =, ==, !=, <>. Will need booleans for suppression procs, anyway.

* Instead of "This report has been modified" in save dialog, use report
  title.

* Handle page/paper orientations in layout engines.

* Handle page/paper orientations in design window.

* ASCII layout engine.

* RTF layout engine.

* Group display name different from group value.

* Provide schema-building scripts for ODBC databases.

* Suppression procs: implement, load, save.

* Arbitrary SQL?

* Hide ancillary windows when another report window becomes the front one.
  We'll need to associate those windows with the report window first, of
  course.

* Line types (dash, etc.)

* Fix DTD

* When have visual preview of output, only read first page from database.

* Special fields: report.date, report.time, report.datetime, run.date,
  run.time, run.datetime

* Graph generation.

* In border tab, example field that displays selected border edges.

Notes
================================================================

Installer script that edits classpath?

Formula language: keep RPN, use embedded Ruby, or write a tree parser?
Formulas turn into SQL? How reference other formulas? (Find dependencies
and put them in order in the SQL.) How inclue subtotals?
