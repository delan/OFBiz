    Bugs
================================================================

* Sandeep's Japanese data problem.

* Informix quoted table/col names. [Chad Lemmen <chad@lemmen.com>]

* Char sep problems described by James Lin in
  <http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=1984107>.
  Need to reproduce; need his report XML file.

* Laura's group footer problem. [Laura Moloney, <lmoloney@theradex.com>]

* The scroll bar hops around when you move from page to page. I've worked
  around this by saving the position before switching to a page and then
  switching back, but it still jumps around.

* [Try to reproduce; was not fixed in 0.7.3 or 0.7.4]: The problem occur
  when I used the section suppression proc to suppress 2 detail sections,
  which will only appear once in my report and suppressed throughout. After
  using the suppression proc, all the contents is printed within 1 page,
  but the 2nd page continues to print out the page header and the page
  footer with blank contents. I m using the SWING layout engine. -- Kui
  Mian

  I emailed Kui Mian asking if this had gone away. He said it hadn't.

* When move hidden field, it draws as if not hidden. Outline is drawn
  properly, but text is black instead of gray.

* i can't even open the pdf file -- acrobat tells me there is a sharing
  violation (Real problem: when parameter XML file name is missing, the
  message "please specify one on the command line. Report run has been
  cancelled" appears on the console and the PDF file isn't created
  properly.)

* [Try to reproduce]: Saleem's header/footer problems on Windows. See XML
  files he emailed to me.

* Top margin on page 2 and later. -- Andre'. [I can't reproduce this
  problem.]

* PDF: No special characters like (a-umlaut, u-umlaut) are displayed.
  Andre Wohnig <a.wohnig@thiesen.com> [I can't reproduce this
  problem. I emaled Andre on 2/24.]

  I see them just fine.

* PDF: lines longer than field continue past right side of field.
  Andre' Wohnig <a.wohnig@thiesen.com>

* What happens when you remove a field that has subtotals? See
  Report.getSubtotalFieldsFor().

* Paste problems:

    ** Paste command, when executed, doesn't get put on menu.

    ** When try to drag pasted field, WIERD things happen.

    ** PasteCommand must handle FPLeafInfo objects, too.

    ** PasteCommand must store type of section so paste can paste into
      proper section between reports.

    ** FP window enable/disable cut, copy, paste.

    ** Pasting into another report does not work because the field wants to
       plop itself down in the same section. I need to put in the same
       *logical* section.

    ** Pasting needs to re-fit sections (and on undo, un-re-fit them).

* When run command in field picker, what should happen to undo/redo?

* HTML layout engine doesn't handle vertical placement of fields within a
  section. For example, in postgresql.xml the date is under the report
  title. When output as HTML, the date is to the right of the title.

* If you close a report while editing a text field, the edit is not
  enforced. Capture the dispose? I think that ignoreKeys will be true.

* All dialog boxes must be prevented from opening multiple instances for a
  single design window.

* Why does the window beep when I hit the delete key?

* LaTeX:

-- LaTeX page footer bug: no page number on A4 paper when the LaTeX is run
   through pdflatex (the data is there in the LaTeX file). Output has one
   more row and footer off of bottom of paper. When run pdflatex, PDF
   MediaBox for both US Letter and A4 has same size (but it's A4 size!).

-- Underline always at same height (currently gets pushed down by '#' in
   'Job #') (use baseline?)

-- Limit text to box

    To Do
================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------
Features
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Can we set "default font" for each component(text, formula) because I
  have to change "every" component font in the design ui. -- James Lin
  <inchlin@users.sourceforge.net>

* Use subtotals in formulas.

* Space on swing toolbar between print and navigation.

* Modify group by, sort by, and join dialogs so that they don't have to
  read all tables' columns.

* "All" value for list parameters. -- Lili Kushnir,
  <LKushnir@checkfree.com>

* Handle empty parameters by either using wildcard or null or something
  like that. [Mayur Purandhar <mayur_purandhar@yahoo.com>]

  Add "default value if not specified"?

* Nee a way to not specify top or bottom values of ranges.

* See Todd Davis mods.

* For arbitrary SQL, need to create a SQL parser that understands both
  columns/expressions and table names. Big, big problem with reading result
  metadata after query has run: the PostgreSQL ResultSet object only
  returns column name, not the table or schema name.

* Better error message when column not found when reading XML (for example,
  join columns).

* Report error messages to user when Ruby scripts fail.

* Add startup script prefix to datavision.properties, something like this.

    module DV
	LAYOUT_ENGINE = :INSERT_LAYOUT_ENGINE_NAME_AS_SYMBOL_HERE
	# ...
    end

  Users can then refer to DV::LAYOUT_ENGINE in their scripts.

* Due to RMI considerations, we were forced to separate the actual data-
  and metadata-retrieval of DataVision and replace some components with
  Serializable equivalents. After succesful implementation, we found that
  the grouping feature generated an error in the Query.java because it
  could not find the first element in the columns ArrayList.
	 
  We believe that is has to do with the fact that the .indexOfColumn()
  method uses the standard method for comparing objects of the ArrayList
  class, which would be too low-level to accurately compare objects. For
  our project, we have overridden this .indexOfColumn() method with a
  simple for-loop and added a higher-level .equals() method to the Column
  class. This way, it seems to work correct when using groups. Since it may
  be a valid suggestion, we decided to send you a mail with this
  modification for your consideration. If you have any questions or
  comments, feel free to EMail us back. -- Gert Van De Slijke
  <Gertvds@landc.be>

  It is sufficient to write Column.equals() (as he suggested) without
  rewriting Query.indexOfColumn(). ArrayList.indexOf() calls equals().

* Let user set default font, font size, etc. for new fields. -- Andre
  Wohnig <a.wohnig@thiesen.com>

* Marker in command history when save file.

* When creating a new report, specify data source. If charsep, get column
  metadata either as a URL or as a list.

* PDF base fonts don't necessarily show up in the list of fonts in the
  format dialog. -- Russell V. Toone <russ@redcon.com>

* Parameter gets values from database column. -- Helga Wyns

	* XML read and write
	* Read data from database
	* GUI
	* Documentation
	* Test

* Where clause gui drag-and-drop. -- Edwin Ramirez

* Applet: java.lang.RuntimePermission exitVM denied.

* Script for section output (e.g., group output). (Hmm...what did I mean
  by that?)

* Investigate Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) for JRuby and other scripting
  languages. -- Todd J. Davis <tdavis@msfw.com>

* Turn schema.table.column into Table Ruby object with column ivar and
  schema object with table ivar.

* Expand name field when AskStringDialog is grown.

* In an oracle environment where multiple schemas with the same table/view
  definition exist, how do we generate reports without the schema name
  attached to the database field names, and run the report using the
  default schema of the user who is running the report? -- Tai-Jen Gordon
  <tjfong@users.sourceforge.net>

  Perhaps I should add an "ignore schema name" flag? Ugh.

* OLAP (drill-down) features.

* Use where clause in charsep source: evaluate it as a formula and only
  select the record if the formula's value returns true.

* Use I18N.get(String, int) when reading paper.properties. Problem: this is
  read during static initialization, so will the locale be correct?

* Option for CSV to suppress all but detail row? -- Don Widkelgren
  <dtwickelgren@users.sourceforge.net>

  Section suppression procs could do this, if (a) they knew which layout
  engine was being used and (b) they existed.

* Add DataSource.setReport(). This allows data sources to be re-used from
  report to report. This is important when you have a connection you want
  to re-use. The Database ctor that takes a conn also takes a report, and
  report is immutable. It shouldn't be. Tai-Jen Gordon
  <tgordon@scintelligence.com>

  All you have to do is add a setReport() method to Database. It has to do
  two things: set the report and create a new SQLQuery.

    public void setReport(Report r) {
	report = r;
	query = new SQLQuery(report);
    }

* Report calls datasource.setReport.

* Disable "Delete Selected" button from join dialog when there are no
  entries in the list.

* I'd like to see each parameter object have a isSet flag in it. isSet
  would default to false, then when Parameter.setValue() gets called isSet
  is made true. Then when Report.runReport() is called if all the
  Parameters have isSet == true then it doesn't run askForParameters(). --
  Brian Johnson <bmj@camfour.com>

* HTML layout engine option: page headers and footers only once; ignore
  page breaks.

* Info display for sections: height, number of fields.

* Warning if section height totals (page headers plus details, at least)
  are greater than page height.

* Add getValue() to all things (columns) for which we now call
  report.columnValue().

* PDF layout engine:
    * Underline
    * Images
    * Borders
    * Lines

* XML data source. "row-end-tag" attribute defines end of detail row. Do we
  need a new column attribute that defines an xml element attribute that
  use used as part of the column name? For example, the XML fragment

    <my-col name="col1">value one</my-col>
    <my-col name="col2">123</my-col>

  couldn't distinguish between what are two different columns. How about
  <column name="my-col" name-attr="name" />?

* Let text column fields expand vertically based on data.

* Even/odd page distinction (sections print even only/odd only/both). Idea
  by Oleg <oleg_vn@users.sourceforge.net>.

* Allow user columns for group values. Zed A. Shaw <zed.shaw@ubc.ca>. Make
  column a Value object. Note: can't add anything else (formula, etc.)
  because (a) only user cols are guaranteed to have their values defined
  and (b) we can't sort by any of the others anyway.

* Optionally repeat group header at top of every page (dinesh).

* If a usercolumn uses a COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX one have to do a GROUP BY on
  all the columns used. I have to a check to see if a usercolumn uses
  the above and automatically adds the GROUP BY before the ORDER BY.
  (Eddie)

* Add "quit" to file menu of swing le when it is running standalone.

* Field background color.

* Dragging table into report drags all columns.

* Arrow keys "nudge" selected fields. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Status bar: basic format and position of selected item. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Style gallery; saves space in XML and makes user's formatting easier.
  (Can already use shift-select; applies to all fields.) Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Cut/Paste Format menu item. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Add "hidden" field attribute to format window and format menu. Peter
  Ciuffetti <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Dragging fields: stay within confines of page. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* When opening app with no file, ask to open file instead of assuming new
  report wanted. Peter Ciuffetti <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* Most recent files opened list. Peter Ciuffetti
  <PeterC@KnowledgeSite.com>.

* GUI take paper margins into consideration (grey them? make section
  smaller?) Eddie Carpenter <ecarpenter@itex.co.za>

* Display field types (perhaps in popup). This will require bringing back
  Column's typeString instance variable, which was commented out to reduce
  memory requirements. (Tony)

* Commands

  -- create/delete parameter/formula/user col

* Carlos suggests a record number within groups. Problem: if you have two
  groups and you insert a "rec # in group" special field, how will you know
  which group's count is being displayed?

  This is easy to do with Ruby. Provide an example.

* Paste into drag targets (code windows, report).

* Lazily instantiate tables and their columns.

* Add copyright to source files.

* New duplicate command? Necessary?

* Persistent undo/redo between application runs.

* Idea: use formula to present text interspersed with column data.

* All layout engines: take file object instead of writer?

* Allow creation images using any file. That way, eps, tiff, and png files
  can be included in HTML or LaTeX exports, for example. Display an icon
  representing the image.

* Binary data: see if can convert into a string?

* Page borders.

* Cache images so we don't load the same image page after page.

* Support line and border color in layout engines.

* A user requests, "I would love to be able to print labels using this.
  Columns would need column spacing and row spacing. I would not care about
  the direction of the columns, left to right, or top to down."

* Different color (e.g., red) if number is negative.

* JFreeChart integration?

* Comments in PaperFormat.java.

* Comments in SortedListModel.java.

* Comments in new Swing classes.

* When placing a text widget, let ESC key cancel operation.

* Turn "http:", "ftp:" etc. into hyperlinks in HTML and DocBook layout
  engines. How about XML and LaTeX (use htlink command)? David Jones
  <jonesde@ofbiz.org>

* Test for non-null format when field created by being dragged. (really
  default format not containing null color).

* On OS X, Command-Q quits app with no chance of saving report. Is there
  any way of trapping that?

* Allow column names (not table.column) in editor windows, but only if the
  name is (a) unique across all tables and (b) not an otherwise reserved
  word.

* Separate XML file for database connection info (perhaps via a URL)? That
  way the report can be distributed to separate users or used with separate
  database instances.

* Keyboard navigation and defaults for dialogs.

* In the field picker window, visually mark formulas and parameters used in
  the report.

* Add more screenshots. One with everything open?

* Pop-up list of example driver names and connection strings? Suggestion
  from Guido Amoruso <guidonte@libero.it>.

* Send email to swing-feedback@java.sun.com. See
  http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/sightings/.

* Allow subtotaling of time intervals.

* Add printout and export examples to Web site.

* Access to SQL functions like SUM, AVG. New field type?

* Cataloging/searching reports (XML files).

* Arrow keys nudge selected fields a pixel at a time.

* When trying to log in, notify user of error messages. Perhaps quit after
  three or five times instead of looping indefinitely.

* Let user open connection info dialog from login dialog.

* Make formats easier to use. Don't require user to understand
  SimpleDateFormat and DecimalFormat.

* Can we use SQL error number or message to determine if we want to retry a
  botched login? How was it botched: bad password or something else?

* Avoid circular references in formulas.

* Need another way to open field picker window besides the "Insert" menu.

* Joins should support inner and outer joins.

* Let user enable/disable ErrorHandler's stack trace printing.

* In db conn info window, disable OK and Apply buttons until both class
  name and conn info are supplied.

* Save last used directory of file open widget.

* Save layout engine type in report for use as default next time?

* Let report run window use same code as design window to export report.

* Factor out common code in GroupWin and SortWin?

* "Are you sure?" when exporting over an existing file.

* CharSepLE: make quotes around fields optional, at least for fields that
  don't contain quotes or separator characters.

* Display borders in Swing layout. Problem: borders in LaTeX are outside
  the bounds, borders in Swing are much easier to implement inside the bounds.

* Shortcut keys for buttons like Yes/No/Cancel and OK/Apply/Revert/Cancel.

* Reduce coupling (Demeter principle).

* VisTableWin: only enable Delete Selected button when some join's delete
  check box is selected.

* Save window positions and sizes. Save info in report XML?

* Visual join editor (tables are visual; drag arrows between columns to
  create joins).

* Formula parser checks syntax and types.

* Dynamically load LayoutEngine subclasses. Allows for dynamic extension.

* Use XQL?

* Use XSchema instead of DTD?

* Select fields by clicking and dragging a selection box with the mouse.
  (Can already use shift-select, of course.)

* Field picker toolbar: create, delete, edit.

* Use Action objects for actions common to menu and popup? The problem is
  that some shared actions aren't really identical when invoked from the
  window menu and from a field (the popup in the field).

* Icons for field picker win.

* Grid toggle for window. When moving or putting down (drag and drop)
  fields, snap to grid. Menu item in Format menu.

* Can add action listener to an entire menu instead of just one item at a
  time.

* Use a Menu Listener. That way we can enable/disable menus in dialog
  window without resorting to calling enable after every select. (See JMenu
  addMenuListener)

* Installer script that edits classpath?

* Logo for DataVision.

* Image for dragging fields (use Field.DEFAULT_WIDTH and
  Field.DEFAULT_HEIGHT).

* Design window toolbar (make it optional).

* Suggestions from Tony: combos, areas, checkbox, background, working
  borders, line, rectangles.

* Instead of "This report has been modified" in save dialog, use report
  title.

* Handle page/paper orientations in layout engines.

* Handle page/paper orientations in design window.

* ASCII layout engine.

* RTF layout engine.

* Group display name different from group value.

* Provide schema-building scripts for ODBC databases.

* Arbitrary SQL?

  Row.getObject should take string name, not int index.

  Introduce new interface for objects with ids. (Done: Identity).

* Hide ancillary windows when another report window becomes the front one.
  We'll need to associate those windows with the report window first, of
  course.

* Line types (dash, etc.)

* Fix DTD.

* When have visual preview of output, only read first page from database.

* Special fields: report.date, report.time, report.datetime, run.date,
  run.time, run.datetime

* Graph generation.

* In border tab, example field that displays selected border edges.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Testing
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Formula tests to make sure a formula field's formula never gets executed
  twice.

* Write test for Ruby script eval in char sep row where clause.

* Suppression proc test.

* User column tests.

* I'm testing for the wrong thing with respect to generation of new ids. I
  should not test to see that the new id == max old id + 1, but rather that
  the new id is unique.

* Test for formula value in group footer. Make sure it doesn't revert to
  old value.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Informix docs from Chad Lemmen.

* Add success stories to Web site.

* (after writing setReport) New DataSource.setReport; describe in
  embed.html.

* Add "no group by" to FAQ.

* Complete javadoc comments.

* Testdata directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Translations
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Possible Serbian and Croation from Ilija, Gojkovic
  <Ilija.Gojkovic@bcferries.com>

* Waiting for Chinese from Liangw <liangw-tek@21.com>

* Possible Dutch from Nils Ottevanger <N.Ottevanger@hetnet.nl>

* Web interface for translation submission. Even better, Translate-O-Matic
  Java application.

* Add more comments to datavision.properties for translation program.
