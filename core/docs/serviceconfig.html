<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<hr>

<p>This document describes the configuration of the Service Engine. It starts
with an introduction to general ideas and then goes through each part of the
serviceengine.xml file and explains the available elements and their 
usage. The serviceengine.xml file used for the OFBiz applications has
examples of a number of different options and is located in <b><code>ofbiz/commonapp/etc/serviceengine.xml</code></b>.</p>

<p>The configuration of the Service Engine is done through a simple XML
file called <b><code>serviceengine.xml</code></b> that must exist somewhere on the classpath.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="Resource">Resource Loaders</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The <b><code>resource-loader</code></b> tag is used to configure a named resource loader
that can be used elsewhere to load XML and other resources. It has the following
attributes.</p>
<table cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' border='1'>
<tr>
    <td><b>Attribute&nbsp;Name</b></td>
    <td><b>Required?</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>name</td><td>Y</td>
    <td>The name of the resource loader. Used in other tags in the 'loader' attribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>class</td><td>Y</td>
    <td>The class to use that extends the abstract class org.ofbiz.core.service.config.ResourceLoader.
    Available classes include FileLoader, UrlLoader, and ClasspathLoader, all in the
    same package as the ResourceLoader class.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>prepend-env</td><td>N</td>
    <td>The name of a Java environment property to put at the very beginning of 
    the full location, before the prefix. This is optional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>prefix</td><td>N</td>
    <td>A string to put before the location when making the full location. This is optional.
    If used will go after the prepended environment property and before the location
    specified for each resource.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<!-- 
  - Just commenting this out for now, this is now in an XML file and is much
  - more complex, so a separate document should probably be used to describe that

<h3><a name="servicesengine">servicesengine.properties</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The servicesengine.properties file contains some global settings for 
the Service Engine.</p>

<p>The Service Engine allows services to be attached to different contexts where
each context has its own class loader. In addition to these local contexts there
is a single global context that also has its own class loader and the service
definition files for the global context are specified using the 
<b><code>global.paths</code></b> property. The value of this property should be
a semicolon separated list of full path and filenames for the service
definition XML files.</p>

<p>The Service Engine also allows either a username/password combination or a 
UserLogin GenericValue object to be passed in for authentication. When a 
UserLogin GenericValue object is passed in the user is assumed to be authenticated,
but when a username/password is specified the user will be authenticated and a 
UserLogin GenericValue object will be created and place in the context for the
service to be called. To specify the name of the service which will be called
to authenticate users when a username/password is specified use the 
<b><code>auth.service</code></b> property where the value is simply the name
of the desired service.</p>

<p>One of the more important uses of this properties file is to specify the class
names for the engine wrappers for various type of services. The format of these
properties is <b><code>{engine-name}.engine={class-name}</code></b> where engine-name
is the value of the 'engine' attribute of the 'service' tag in a service definition 
XML file and class-name is the fully-qualified class name for a class that 
implements the <b><code>org.ofbiz.core.service.GenericEngine</code></b> interface.
Valid engine-names include: <b><code>java</code></b>, <b><code>workflow</code></b>,
<b><code>bsh</code></b>, and <b><code>soap</code></b>.</p>
