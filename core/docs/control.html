<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a> </h3>

<p>The Open For Business Controller is a group of classes use to manage the
presentation    of a web application designed around the Open For Business
framework. The Controller is designed to work along with the Entity Engine
by keeping a constant state with the Entity Delegator, as well as the Services
Framework by keeping a state with the Local Service Dispatcher. The goal
of the Controller is to provide a clean mechanism of separating presentation
logic from the actual display.<br>
<br>
    This Controller makes use of several J2EE Presentation Tier design patterns.
   The Context Security Filter is modeled after the <i><a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/restricted/patterns/DecoratingFilter.html">
 Decorating    Filter</a>
</i> pattern. The CSF runs at the context root and is able to restrict
direct access to JSP templates as well as open doors for future services such
   as debugging, logging and compression. The Control Servlet is modeled after
   the <i><a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/restricted/patterns/FrontController.html">
 Front    Controller</a>
</i> pattern. This Servlet is where the web application's request processing
begins. It makes use of helper classes which process security and events,
then dispatches to a defined view. The Views are JSP templates which    are
very similar to those described in the <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/restricted/patterns/CompositeView.html"><i>
 Composite    View</i></a>
  pattern. These templates use helper files to limit the amount of logic found
in the actual display page. These helper files are Java classes    which
perform the logic for a specific group of views. This process is based
 on the <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/restricted/patterns/ViewHelper.html"><i>
 View    Helper</i></a>
  pattern.<br>
<br>
    As stated above, the main purpose of the Controller is to separate logic
from    display. This is accomplished by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using a Filter to secure JSP template in the web application</li>
  <li>Using a Servlet to manage application flow</li>
  <li>Using Events (commands) and View Helpers for presentation logic</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ContextSecurityFilter">Context Security Filter</a>
</h3>
<hr> The Context Security Filter (CSF) defined in <i>/WEB-INF/web.xml </i>
 is used to  restrict access to the web application files. In the future
it may be used for  debugging and/or logging requests. This is the starting
point for all web requests  to the application. By default all paths are rejected
and only paths specifically  defined are allowed direct access. The CSF is
set to allow all requests to the  <a href="#ControlServlet">Control Servlet</a>
  by setting the mount point of the  Servlet in the 'allow list'. The allow
list is defined as an init-param named  <i>allowedPaths</i>.The value is
a single string of paths separated by  a colon. The example webapps allow
'/control:/index.html:/index.jsp:/default.html:/default.jsp:/images'  paths.
A path may be a directory name (starting from the root directory of the
webapp) or a path to a specific file. <br>
<br>
  Example: '/images' will allow all files in the /images directory to be
directly  accessed. <br>
  Example: '/site-pages/contactus.html' will allow only the contactus.html
file  found in the /site-pages directory to be directly accessed. <br>
 Example: '/site-pages/info/*' will allow only the files in the subdirectory
'info' to be directly accessed.<br>
<br>
  When a direct request to a protected path is made the filter will do one
of two  things. One, the filter can redirect the user to a page defined in
<i>web.xml</i>.  This is defined by setting the init-param <i>redirectPath</i>
  to properly formatted  URL. Two, the filter will throw a server error which
can be defined by the init-param  <i>errorCode</i>. The error is thrown only
if there is no redirect defined. If  no errorCode is defined, the filter will
throw a 404 server error.<br>
<br>
  The configuration looks like this:<br>
<pre>&lt;filter&gt; <br>  &lt;filter-name&gt;ContextSecurityFilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;<br>  &lt;display-name&gt;ContextSecurityFilter&lt;/display-name&gt; <br>  &lt;filter-class&gt;org.ofbiz.core.control.ContextSecurityFilter&lt;/filter-class&gt;    <br>  &lt;init-param&gt; <br>    &lt;param-name&gt;allowedPaths&lt;/param-name&gt; <br>    &lt;param-value&gt;/control:/index.html:/index.jsp:/default.html:/default.jsp:/images&lt;/param-value&gt;    <br>  &lt;/init-param&gt; <br>  &lt;init-param&gt; <br>    &lt;param-name&gt;errorCode&lt;/param-name&gt;    <br>    &lt;param-value&gt;403&lt;/param-value&gt; <br>  &lt;/init-param&gt; <br>&lt;/filter&gt;    <br>&lt;filter-mapping&gt; <br>  &lt;filter-name&gt;ContextSecurityFilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;    <br>  &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt; <br>&lt;/filter-mapping&gt; </pre>

<h3><a name="ControlServlet">Control Servlet</a>
</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Control Servlet is at the heart of all request processing. Valid requests
  which pass through the <a href="#ContextSecurityFilter">Context Security Filter</a>
  begin processing here. When a request is received, the Control Servlet first
  sets up an environment for the helper classes. This environment includes (but
  is not limited to) setting up an initial session object and storing useful information
  about the initial request and setting a reference to the Entity Delegator, Service
  Dispatcher, and Security Handler for use by the helper classes. The request
  is then passed to the <a href="#RequestHandler"> Request Handler</a> for processing.
  The <a href="#RequestHandler">Request Handler</a> processes the request and&nbsp;
  returns the path and name of a JSP template page (<i>view</i>) which the Control
  Servlet then dispatches to. </p>
<p>When the Control Servlet is first loaded it will create objects used by the
  web application and store them in the application context (ServletContext).
  These objects can be found by accessing the property in the context or via a
  JSP &lt;useBean&gt; tag. These objects include: Entity Delegator, Security object,
  Service Dispatcher, and the <a href="#RequestHandler">Request Handler</a>.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="RequestHandler">Request Handler</a>
</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Request Handler makes use of a Request Manager helper class to gather
a    list of request mappings defined in an XML configuration file. The configuration
   file lives in /WEB-INF for the appropriate context. The mapping consists
of    a request URI and an optional VIEW name. View names are mapped to JSP
templates    in the configuration file as well. A request URI can also be
associated with    an <i>Event</i>. Events are used to process web related
logic by either working directly with the Entity    Engine through the Entity
Delegator or invoking service(s) to handle the logic through the Service Dispatcher.<br>
<br>
    When a request is received through the Request Handler it is first looked
up    in the request mappings, if no mapping is found an unknown request error
is    returned. Upon a successful lookup, the Security Handler is called to
verify    if the current request requires authentication and the user making
the request    is properly authenticated. If the current user is not authenticated
the Request    Handler redirects the request to a proper login form. After
successful authentication    or if no authentication is required the Request
Handler then looks up a defined    event for this request. If an event is
found, the request is passed to the <a href="#Event%20Handler"> Event
Handler</a>
  for processing. After event processing is complete, the default    view
is looked up for this request, unless the <a href="#EventHandler">Event
  Handler</a>
  requests a specific view instead. The view is then checked in the    view
mappings and the JSP template name is returned to the <a href="#ControlServlet">
 Control    Servlet</a>
  for dispatching. If the view type is 'NONE' it is expected that the event
handles the response itself, if the view type is 'REDIRECT' the RequestHandler
then redirects to the specified URL and the ControlServlet is told not to
dispatch.<br>
<br>
    The Request Handler looks up request mappings in an XML file which is
setup    like this:<br>
</p>
<pre>  &lt;request-map uri="checkLogin" edit="false"&gt;<br>    &lt;description&gt;Verify a user is logged in.&lt;/description&gt;<br>    &lt;security https="false" auth="false"/&gt;<br>    &lt;event type="java" path="org.ofbiz.commonapp.security.login.LoginEvents" invoke="checkLogin" /&gt;<br>    &lt;response name="success" type="view" value="name" /&gt;<br>    &lt;response name="error" type="view" value="login" /&gt;<br>  &lt;/request-map&gt;<br></pre>
<p> In the above mapping, the event return code <i>success</i> will load the
view    named <i>main</i>. If <i>success</i> was defined with the type&nbsp;
<i>request </i>it would    then instead of displaying a view, it in turn call
another request. This is    known as <i>request chaining</i>.<br>
<br>
    The view mappings are defined as follows:</p>
<pre>  &lt;view-map name="login" page="/login.jsp"/&gt;<br></pre>
<p>A view is looked up by name and mapped to a JSP template (page).<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="EventHandler">Event Handler</a>
</h3>
<hr>
<p>Event Handlers are defined in the XML config file such as:</p>
<pre>  &lt;handler name="java" class="org.ofbiz.core.event.JavaEventHandler"/&gt;</pre>
<p>As in the above request mapping the login event is defined with a type
of 'Java'.  The event type is mapped to an Event Handler using the handler
definitions. Custom  Event Handlers can be designed and would be implemented
like the above example. </p>
<p>   Java events are processed by locating the path of the event (package
and classname)    then by using the Reflection API the Event Handler invokes
the method defined.    A String object is returned to the <a href="#RequestHandler">
 Request Handler</a>
  which is mapped to the response element of the request definition.<br>
<br>
  A document on writing <i>Open For Business Events and Services</i> is forthcoming.</p>
