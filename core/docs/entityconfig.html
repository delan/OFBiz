<p>This document describes the configuration of the Entity Engine. It starts
with an introduction to general ideas and then goes through each part of the
entityengine.properties file and explains the available properties and their 
usage. The entityengine.properties file used for the OFBiz applications has
examples of a number of different options and is located in <b>ofbiz/commonapp/etc/entityengine.properties</b>.</p>

<p>The configuration of the Entity Engine is done through a simple properties
file called <b>entityengine.properties</b> that must exist somewhere on the classpath. This
properties file is used to define parameters for persistence servers such as EJB
server parameters or JDBC server parameters. It is also used to specify which
XML entity, entity group, and field type model files will be used for that server.
The default file for the OFBiz distribution can be found in <b>ofbiz/commonapp/etc/entityengine.properties</b>.</p>

<p>Each application that uses the Entity Engine does so through a <b>GenericDelegator</b>
instance. The delegator name must be passed to the static factory method which
is then passed to the constructor if a new instance is needed. This delegator
name is used to look up settings for that delegator in the <b>entityengine.properties</b>
file. Each delegator uses an entity model XML file and an entity group XML file
which specifies a group name for each named entity in the entity model file. The
<b>entityengine.properties</b> file contains the settings which map each group name
to a <b>GenericHelper</b> for that group. <b>GenericHelper</b> is an interface
that must be implemented for each type of data source (ie: JDBC, EJB, SOAP,
HTTP, et cetera).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The setting for each named <b>GenericHelper</b> are specified in the <b>entityengine.properties</b>
file. For a JDBC helper these would include database connection parameters such
as either the JNDI data source name or the JDBC parameters including the driver
name, the JDBC URI, and the username and password for the database. An EJB
helper would contain the context provider URL, the initial context factory, and
the URL package prefixes.</p>

<p>The <b>GenericDelegator</b> is the primary access method for Entity Engine
services. Each service request is dispatched to the helper that corresponds to
the entity that the service is requested for according to the group name of the
entity specified in the entity group XML file and the helper for that group
specified in the <b>entityengine.properties</b> file. The default entity group XML
file for the OFBiz entity model can be found in <b>ofbiz/commonapp/entitydef/entitygroup.xml</b>.</p>
