/*
Here is a simple example of lists. An element is a member of a list if it is
the head of the list or part of the tail.

Try the query:
    member(champion, ["spassky", "fischer", "karpov", "kasparov"])
which should produce the result:
    champion = spassky
    champion = fischer
    champion = karpov
    champion = kasparov
    no more results
*/
member(X, [X | Rest]);
member(X, [Y | Rest]) :- member(X, Rest);
