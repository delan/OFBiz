<P>The Data File Library is a tool used to read and write "flat" files. It
allows you to work with the flat file data in a more natural way using generic
objects similar to the Entity Engine GenericValue object.</P>

<P>The design is very similar to the Entity Engine in that there is an XML
configuration file that is used to specify the format and structure of the flat
file and a generic API used to deal with the records in the file. One major
difference is that datafile records are hierarchical and a record can have
various sub-records. The descriptor file is also structured this way so that
each record type can have a parent record type.</P>

<P>When the file is read the library will convert strings of various formats and
styles into numbers, dates, etc. It also supports common flat-file formats such
as zero padded numbers, implied fixed decimal point numbers, and dates with no 
delimeters.</P>

<P>Sorry about the lack of further documentation on this. For more info see the
datafiles.dtd file, or throw us an email to let us know that there is further
interest in documentation for this component.</P>
