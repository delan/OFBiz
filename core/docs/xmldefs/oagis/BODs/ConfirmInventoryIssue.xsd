This BOD is also used to notify a Manufacturing Application of the return of material from a production order back into inventory. The business environments most likely to require this capability are any type of manufacturing scenario.

This BOD communicates what the item is that is being issued, where it is being issued from, which processing operation it is being issued to, what quantity was issued, and at what time this event occurred. In the case of a return, this BOD communicates what the item is that is being returned, which processing operation it is being returned from, which inventory location it is being returned to, the quantity being returned, and the time at which this event occurred.
