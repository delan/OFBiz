The business environments most likely to require this capability are any type of manufacturing scenario.

This BOD communicates which processing step the product is coming from and which step it is being moved to, along with the quantity moving and the time this event occurred.

This BOD assumes that the applications involved in this business scenario will have already synchronized the production item and its BOM/Routing information.</xs:documentation>
