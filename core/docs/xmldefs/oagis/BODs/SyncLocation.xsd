                        <xs:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis">The purpose of the Sync Location is to enable a mechanism to ensure that the physical location identifiers are synchronized between the business applications that require this to communicate clearly.  This is particularly critical when only the codes that identify locations are used.  Without the meaning of the codes clearly communicated, the integration is not effective.  This BOD enables the Location codes to be synchronized among business applications.

This BOD may also be initiated by the sending system upon some event occurring.

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, a MRP, Inventory, or Manufacturing business application could use this to communicate Location information.
