                        <xs:documentation source="http://www.openapplications.org/oagis">The Create verb is used to describe specific processing in a more fine grained manner beyond add, change or delete processing.  This is generally used when the processing is initiating the building of a document, rather than moving a document from one system to another.  Examples of this include CREATE PRODORDER and CREATE BOM.
In these cases, the documents have not been constructed and need to be.  This differs from the ADD PO or ADD REQUISITN processing as those requests refer to a document that has already been established and the document is being communicated to another business application.</xs:documentation>
