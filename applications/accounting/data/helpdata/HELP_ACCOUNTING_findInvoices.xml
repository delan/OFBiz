	<title>The Accounting Find Invoices help screen.</title>
	<para>The default screen is for the Invoices tab is 'Find Invoices'. It
		is used to locate existing invoices that have been created
		automatically by the system or manually by the user. It can also be
		used to create a new Sales or Purchase Invoice. </para>
	<para>
		Sales invoices are generated when customers buy something from your
		business.
		You will need to provide a detailed list of the items bought and relevant
		taxes paid. They are often referred to a 'tax invoices' as they
		contain
		information relating to the amount of sales tax (eg VAT / GST)
		charged on the product or service.
		</para>
	<para> Purchase invoices are generated by your suppliers when you
		order something from them. You may send them an order in the form of
		a Purchase Order. They will then send you the products and an invoice
		for payment. This invoice is the Purchase Invoice and it will contain
		details of the items bought plus any taxes.</para>
	<para> Both of these documents are used as proof to various tax
		authorities (eg Inland Revenue, Customs etc) that the required tax
		has been charged or collected.</para>
	<para>
		GENERAL NOTE: The following is an extract from Ian McNulty's
		documentation work on accounting:</para>
	<para>Invoices are created automatically by the system when
		certain criteria are met for each item on an order. The criteria
		will vary depending on the type of product associated with the
		order item, and the type of order (ie purchase/sales).</para>
	<para>For Sales Orders that include digital goods, an invoice
		will be created when the order is placed, and that invoice will be
		for all digital goods in the order. If there are non-digital or
		physical goods they will go in a separate invoice.</para>
	<para>For Sales Orders that need physical fulfillment, an
		invoice will be created for all items in a shipment when the
		shipment goes into the 'Packed' status.</para>
	<para>For Purchase Orders an invoice will be created from a
		shipment when the shipment goes into the Received status.</para>
