               <para>An example of how to bring in an opening balance is shown below:</para>
            <para>Navigate to the the Financial Account Transactions sub menu</para>

               <para>Fill in the 'Entry Date' field (NOTE TO CHECK: Need to check exactly what this is - is it the date the transaction is entered or is it the date the transaction is processed?)</para>
               <para>Fill in the 'Amount' field with the transaction amount (Eg. In our case this is the opening balance such as 353.88 - dont think we need the $ sign)</para>

              <para>Leave the 'Reason Enum Id' field blank (NOTE TO CHECK: This could be useful in identifying transactions to a greater level of detail....)</para>
              <para>Fill in the 'Comments' field (Eg: Opening Balance from XYZ Statement)</para>
              <para>Press the 'Add' button and the transaction will be displayed at the bottom of the screen</para>
            <para>NOTE: When you now view the Financial Account detail the 'Actual Balance' and 'Available Balance' fields will show the entered opening balance (eg 353.88)</para>
