        <para>
            I was reading the book in development from Norman Walsh called <link xl:href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/docbook.html">DocBook 5.0: The Definitive Guide
            </link> and found that a book can have a dedication. My first thought was there is only one man to whom this book can be dedicated. Without him I would not have been writing it.
            Sometimes i talk to other people about my dinners with David Jones in Pucket, Thailand which were very revealing to me. At a relative young age David designed and developed with Andy Zenesky 
            the cornerstones of the OFBiz system called entity engine and recognized that in 2001 SOA (System Oriented Architecture) would be the future. 
            So, David, thank you very much spending your efforts creating this excellent system.

        <title>Introduction.</title>
        <para>
            Welcome to Apache OFBiz, the ready to use open source ERP system. Let me first say if you downloaded 
            the system for the first time it will be very overwhelming because the system is pretty big what is actually pretty normal for an ERP system
            because of its size.
        </para>
        <para>
            This document is describing the technical aspects of the system. How to install it, how to load the data and how to make the system available to the Internet.
            This is described pretty well in the 'production setup guide' in the next section. If you looking how to setup the system from a user point of view then better
            have a look at the Apache OFBiz user guide.

                <para>Upgrade Linux to Ubuntu/Debian remotely using Grub menu</para>
                <para>
                    Although OFBiz will be run on most operating systems a lot of installations are done on either Debian or
                    Ubuntu which is also based on Debian.
                </para>
                <para>
                    If you have a version if Linux running already on your server which using the GRUB menu, it is possible to upgrade to Debian/Ubuntu
                    without even touching the server physically. With the method below the debian installer is loaded into a Ram disk from where it can
                    reformat and repartition the harddisk and install the system.
                    Practice this first on a local server, because if after the reboot the server is unreachable you have to ask somebody at the datacenter to manually reboot the system.

        <title>The Apache OFBiz documentation system</title>

    <section>
        <title>Overview.</title>
        <para>
            The OFBiz documentation system consist out of a number of DocBook xml
            files. In general the files are stored within the subject
            component either in the 'documents' or data/helpdata
            directories.
            The 'master' document is stored in the file
            applications/commonext/documents/ApacheOfbiz.xml. The
            docbook schemas are stored in the applications/content/dtd
            directory and the stylesheets are
            stored in the applications/content/templates/docbook directory.  
        </para>
        <para>
            the definition of the content and dataresource records can be found in
            the application/content/data/ContentType.xml file at the
            bottom. They are in this file because the documentation and
            helpfile
            are considered 'seed' data: essential for the operation of OFBiz.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you are looking for docbook files format examples, please
            look at the following files:
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The master document at:
                        applications/commonext/documents/ApacheOfbiz.xml
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>An example for a chapter of a component at:
                        applications/accounting/documents/Accounting.xml
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>An example of a help screen:
                        applications/accounting/data/helpdata/HELP_ACCOUNTING_main.xml

                <listitem>
                    <para>An example of content creation:
                        applications/accounting/data/AccountingHelpData.xml

    <section>
        <title>Contributing a new help screen, a few steps.</title>
        <para>
            So if you would like to create a new help menu for a certain
            screen, you need to do the following:
            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>In the helplink.ftl un-comment the
                        ${helpTopic} variable so it will appear at the
                        top right hand of your screen</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>in the specific component data/helpData create
                        the HELP_${helpTopic}.xml file. you can find an
                        example in the HELP_ACCOUNTING_main.xml file.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Update/create the
                        data/${componentName}HelpData.xml, an example
                        can be found in the AccountingHelpData.xml. If
                        new make also an entry in the
                        ofbiz-component.xml</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Load the HelpDataFile and the file should
                        show up when you click on the help button.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Submit the change to the svn repository or
                        create a diff file and attach it to a jira
                        issue.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        If the help text is usefull in the ofbiz document include it in the files in the document directory.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title><anchor id="helpInternationalization"/>Internationalization of the help system</title>
        <para>
            Because the help system is making use of the content component, internationalization of the help files is very easy because 
            it is a basic function of the content component. If you want to make a translation of an existing help file, make a copy in the same directory 
            and make it unique by attaching the "_languageCode" at he end.
            Create, as also was done for the english version a dataresource and content record in the data/${componentName}HelpData.xml file.
            Then create an ContentAssoc record in data/${componentName}HelpData.xml file to associate this new file with the english file with the type
            ALTERNATE_LOCALE. Please find below an example from the ContentHelpData.xml for a Dutch version of the root help file.
            <programlisting>
    &lt;!-- how to create alternative locales --&gt;
    &lt;DataResource dataResourceId="HELP_ROOT_NL" localeString="nl" dataResourceTypeId="OFBIZ_FILE" 
        objectInfo="applications/content/data/helpdata/HELP_ROOT_NL.xml" dataTemplateTypeId="NONE" statusId="CTNT_IN_PROGRESS" 
        dataResourceName="Help system root" mimeTypeId="text/xml" isPublic="Y" /&gt;
    &lt;Content contentId="HELP_ROOT_NL" contentTypeId="DOCUMENT" templateDataResourceId="HELP_TEMPL" 
        dataResourceId="HELP_ROOT_NL" localeString="nl" statusId="CTNT_IN_PROGRESS" 
        contentName="Help system root in dutch" mimeTypeId="text/html"/&gt;
    &lt;ContentAssoc contentId="HELP_ROOT" contentIdTo="HELP_ROOT_NL" 
        contentAssocTypeId="ALTERNATE_LOCALE" fromDate="2006-01-12 01:01:01"/&gt;
            </programlisting> 
            The switching between locales is from then on completely automatic.
