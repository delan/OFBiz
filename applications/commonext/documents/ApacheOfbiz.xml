            This Book is in an experimental stage and acts as a proof of concept. It could be the start of moving the ofbiz documentation from the current 
            <link xl:href="http://docs.ofbiz.org">OFBiz documentation site</link> to the OFBiz content component. It is currently open for discussion by the OFBiz community.
