This app is primarily designed to showcase widget and permission techniques.
Hopefully, someone will come along and add RSS and email connectivity.
I do not have any immediate plans to do so.

Take a look at the seed data to see what users are set up.
Access is completely controlled via the widgets.
There is a "guest" user that can only view blogs and add responses.
There are two authors (ie. david and andy) that can add and edit their own articles,
but not each others.
There is an editor (and admin) that can edit both.
The authors should not be able to edit their articles after the status is set to "BLOG_PUBLISHED".


Since this is a "specialized" app, it is not loaded automatically. 
You must go to the component-load.xml file in the "ofbiz/specialized" dir 
and uncommenting the "community" line. 
This should be done before running "ant run-install" so that the seed data will get loaded.
