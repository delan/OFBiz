     <li> Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQ's, are a good way to address customers' most common questions or concerns about a product.
	 <li> Typical FAQ's can be use, care, and assembly instructions; questions about quality and construction of an item; or general shipping, warranty, and service issues.
     <li> Today, customers with unanswered questions are more likely to walk away than try to call an 800# or send an email.
     <li> Therefore, posting FAQ's not only helps reduce customer service calls but also increases the likelihood of making a sale.
     <li> In our system, FAQ's can be associated with products, product categories, and product catalogs.  When a customer clicks on the FAQ link,
     successive "layers" of FAQ's are retrieved.  This makes easier to maintain a large volume of relevant information for every product.
     <li> FAQ's directly associated with the product will show first, followed by those for the parent categories, and eventually for the entire product catalog.
     <li> The same FAQ's can also be accessed across all sites, including external sites for consumers, retailers, and showrooms/sales reps and internal order entry and customer service agents.
