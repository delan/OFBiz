     <li> For a retailer, leads could come from a consumer who visited the wholesaler/vendor's website and requested product information.
     <li> Or, it could come from consumers and prospects who responded to an advertisement.
     <li> Each consumer's mailing/solicitation/contact preferences would be stored and made available.  Some consumers may want a call back about
     a specific product, while others may just want to be notified of upcoming sales.
     <li> The leads can be automatically downloaded in a text file or spreadsheet, for including into the retailer's mailing list.
     <li> The wholesaler can control which retailers receive which leads (based on account status, purchase volume, etc.)
     <li> <strong>For vendors who run national or regional advertising campaigns, this is an excellent way to demonstrate to retailers the strength of the brand.</strong>
