     <li> For a showroom or sales rep, leads could come from a trade show, the wholesaler's website, or customer service department.
     <li> The leads can be automatically downloaded in a text file or spreadsheet, for including into the showroom/rep's database or contact manager (Outlook, PDA).
     <li> The wholesaler can control which showrooms or reps receive the leads based on territority.
     <li> The wholesaler can also later poll the prospects to make sure that the showroom or rep made the proper follow up.
     <li> Because the system brings together internal order entry and customer service and external websites, leads can be routed <b>immediately</b>, so the showroom 
     or salesrep can respond to fresh leads.
