<br/><strong>Ghillie's Choice</strong> is a new Mail Order / Internet
business, launched in 2005, the business is a partnership between two
very different men, Graham Davy, an international angler who for many
years now has spent his time fishing all over the world and a Scottish
Ghillie, Stuart Rammell. Graham has fished for Salmon with the fly in
many famous locations, Russia, Iceland, America and Canada to name but
a few, he has also caught numerous salt-water species using the fly,
Bonefish, Tarpon and Tuna as well as several other exotic species.
Graham has visited numerous other exciting locations such as Cuba and
Thailand in his pursuit of the best sport fishing with the fly. <br/>
<br/>
Graham's knowledge and experience are wide ranging, he has an active
interest in antique and vintage fishing tackle, particularly British
and American cane rods, he takes great pleasure in fishing with some of
these fine old rods occasionally.<br/><br/>

It was on a trip to Scotland that he met and became friends with
Stuart Rammell. Stuart lives near and fishes on the well known river
Nith in S.W. Scotland where he has worked as an independent Ghillie for
many years. Stuart has been associated with some of the best beats on
the river Nith and is well known and respected by his clients for his
vast knowledge and experience. Indeed many anglers have caught their
first Salmon or Sea Trout under Stuarts guidance, he is an excellent
Sea Trout angler and is always happiest when out on a summer's night in
pursuit of his favourite species. Stuart is an excellent fly tier with
over 40 years experience behind him, he has also worked as a Water
Bailiff and for several years ran his own Fishing Tackle business
dealing in both new and vintage tackle. Stuart is a very keen angler,
he has fished for and caught most of the freshwater species in the
British Isles, he particularly enjoys Pike fishing and has a growing
interest in fly fishing for Pike, a relatively new and exiting way to
catch them.<br/><br/>

The combined fly fishing knowledge and experience of these two men
ensures that the flies offered to you by Ghillie's Choice are of the
finest quality available.
It is not the intention of Ghillie's Choice to offer cheap, mass
produced flies to our customers, our flies are tied using the best
materials available and sourced from the best tiers we can find. The
quality and consistency of our flies is of paramount importance to us,
our policy is simple: we will never offer flies to you, the customer,
if we would not buy or use those same flies ourselves. To back up this
statement we offer a
'no quibble - money back' guarantee with all of our flies.<br/><br/>

Tight Lines,<br>
