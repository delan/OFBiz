 * <p>In practice, an Axiom is either a fact or a rule, the two
 * types of objects that can appear in a program. More
 * precisely, an Axiom has a head structure with which a
 * consulting structure can unify, and an Axiom can produce
 * a ProvableAxiom.
 * <p>
 * Facts are simply true, and return themselves as
 * DynamicAxioms. To prove itself, a Rule needs to
 * create a DynamicAxiom that can attempt to prove
 * itself against an axiom source.
