BEA Weblogic 6.1 SP2 J2EE 1.3 Version

This directory contains files needed to get OFBiz running under BEA Weblogic, 
including sample configurations files for the Entity Engine and Weblogic and
a startup shell script for Weblogic that is a modifications of the 
startWeblogic.sh that is included with the app server.

The startOfbiz.sh file should be placed in your domain directory and run
directly rather than running the startWeblogic.sh file. It referes to the
3rd Party jars used by OFBiz inside the ofbiz/lib directory so you won't
have to copy them.

But, you will HAVE to have $OFBIZ_HOME set to your main ofbiz directory, the
one that contains core, commonapp, setup, etc.

You will also have to update the config.xml file to point to the location of 
the webapp directories. Because Weblogic may be installed in various locations 
relative paths are not used. In the startOfbiz.sh file $OFBIZ_HOME is used to
handle this, but that isn't available in the config.xml file.

Note that the current weblogic transaction factory is included in OFBiz with
the weblogic.transaction specific stuff commented out. To get that to work
you must uncomment the weblogic.transaction parts and comment out the throw
statements, and then compile with weblogic.jar on the classpath. The full
class name is org.ofbiz.core.entity.transaction.WeblogicFactory, as
referenced in the entityengine.xml file (which must replace the
entityengine.xml file in commonapp/etc).

By the way, sorry the config.xml file is all out of order. Weblogic likes to 
read that file and write it out again every time the server runs and it
puts things in the worst order.

Hope that helps.
