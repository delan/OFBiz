Only the license files and files needed for execution and compilation are included here.

For sample data sets, documentation and source visit 
http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/ or sf.net/projects/weka.

Also, note that there is a great book out about this project. I've had this
book for a couple of years. I got it before I even knew about Weka the open
source project. It's called "Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools
and Techniques with Java Implementations."

Special thanks to all of those who have put so much work into this nice application!
