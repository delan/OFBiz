This configuration is for Oracle 9i AS (OC4J) version 9.0.3.0.0, but may work 
with other versions.

This configuration simply requires that you copy the ofbiz.sh and config/*.xml
files to the oc4j/j2ee/home and oc4j/j2ee/home/config directories respectively.

It refers to the OFBiz files in place without modification needed as long as the
oc4j directory is a sibling of the ofbiz root directory that contains all of the
modules.

This configuration has some fairly serious problems with transaction management
and connection handling. It can't find the java:comp/UserTransaction object in
JNDI. So, some work is still needed to make it useful.

Good luck!
