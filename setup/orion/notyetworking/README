This directory is called notyetworking because it contains files for an attempt
that is not yet working, namely using Orion as the TX (JTA) manager and
JDBC connection pooler. This demonstrates how to configure a XA pooled
connection in the data-sources.xml files and the entityengine.properties
demonstrates how to get it out of JNDI.

The reason this work has gone no farther is that I can't find any documentation
on how to get instances of the JTA objects UserTransaction and 
TransactionManager. Without being able to get those two the pooling does us no
good because Tyrex won't work with their transaction wrapper and manager.

So, for now we are just using Tyrex with Orion. It's really silly, I know.
