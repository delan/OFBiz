This Orion deployment is kind of weird, actually Orion is kind of a weird app
server. Note that this deployment does not use Orion's JTA or XA JDBC pooling
implementations because I couldn't find out how to get the JTA UserTransaction
and TransactionManager objects. If anyone knows, please email me.

The performance under Orion is good, though not as good as Weblogic.

To deploy on Orion copy the files in this directory to the Orion root directory
and the files in config to the Orion config directory. Be sure to backup the
files in the config directory that these will overwrite if those files are
important to you.

That done, in the OFBiz home directory run "ant ear" to create the ofbiz.ear
file, and copy that file into orion/applications, where it is referenced in
the config/server.xml file.

Now, go into the Orion home directory and run the "ofbiz-get-files.sh" script
which will copy a bunch of files from the OFBiz directories to the orion/lib
directory. The "ofbiz-remove-files.sh" script can be use to get rid of these.

With all of that in place, just set your $OFBIZ_HOME environment variable
and run "ofbiz.sh" in the Orion root directory.

By the way, be sure to copy the tools.jar file from your JDK lib directory to
the Orion root directory, it needs it there for compilation.

The default entityengine.properties file is used at the moment for Orion
because of the problem mentioned at the top of this file, ie no access to the
JTA interfaces. So, the Tyrex configurations there can be used just fine.


Hope that helps!
