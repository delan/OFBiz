This configuration is for Orion 1.5.2, 1.5.3, 1.5.4, and 1.6.0.

The Orion configuration has been updated quite a bit so that it references 
the OFBiz JAR files in place where they are built by Ant. It also uses the
Orion Connection Pool and Transaction Manager.

With all of that in place, just set your $OFBIZ_HOME (or make sure that 
orion/../ofbiz is the OFBIZ_HOME) environment variable
and run "ofbiz.sh" in the Orion root directory.

The current configuration (in config/application.xml and 
config/default-web-site.xml) look in ../ofbiz/XXX/webapp for the various
OFBiz webapps. Because of this you will either have to change to
application.xml file or put orion and ofbiz as sibling directories.

By the way, be sure to copy the tools.jar file from your JDK lib directory to
the Orion root directory, it needs it there for compilation. Also, be sure to
copy the xerces.jar file from the orion directory to the orion/lib directory
so that your applications can use it.

NOTE: If Tyrex is on your classpath it will mess up the UserTransction JNDI 
lookup. So, make sure it is not there.

Hope that helps!
