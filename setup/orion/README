This configuration is for Orion 1.5.2, 1.5.3, 1.5.4, and 1.6.0.

The Orion configuration has been updated quite a bit so that it references 
the OFBiz JAR files in place where they are built by Ant. It also uses the
Orion Connection Pool and Transaction Manager.

With all of that in place, just set your $OFBIZ_HOME (or make sure that 
orion/../ofbiz is the OFBIZ_HOME) environment variable
and run "ofbiz.sh" in the Orion root directory.

The current configuration (in config/application.xml and 
config/default-web-site.xml) look in ../ofbiz/XXX/webapp for the various
OFBiz webapps. Because of this you will either have to change to
application.xml file or put orion and ofbiz as sibling directories.

By the way, be sure to copy the tools.jar file from your JDK lib directory to
the Orion root directory, it needs it there for compilation.

NOTE: This configuration is not 100% complete. In other words, we haven't been
able to get everything in OFBiz working under Orion. We've resolved most of the
issues, but some remain. The main ones are: not being able to find the 
java:comp/UserTransaction object in JNDI, and certain JSPs 
(like productdetail.jsp) won't compile because of parsing and JSP to Java
translation errors. The productdetail.jsp issue may be related to the JSP
compiler getting confused by the JavaScript in the page, just a guess...

Hope that helps!
