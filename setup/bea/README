BEA Weblogic 6.1 SP2 J2EE 1.3 Version

This directory contains files needed to get OFBiz running under BEA Weblogic, 
including sample configurations files for the Entity Engine and Weblogic and
a startup shell script for Weblogic that is a modifications of the 
startWeblogic.sh that is included with the app server.

The startOfbiz.sh file should be placed in your domain directory and run
directly rather than running the startWeblogic.sh file. It referes to the
3rd Party jars used by OFBiz inside the ofbiz/lib directory so you won't
have to copy them.

But, you will HAVE to have OFBIZ_HOME set to your main ofbiz directory, the
one that contains core, commonapp, setup, etc.

Hope that helps.
