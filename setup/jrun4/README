This configuration is for Macromedia JRun 4.

Using it is pretty simple, but be sure to look at the JRun4 docs for chaning 
the various config files, because there are quite a few.

To get started make sure your JRun4 home directory is a sibling of the ofbiz
home directory. Copy the ofbiz/setup/jrun4/bin/jvm.config file to the 
jrun/bin directory and the ofbiz/setup/jrun4/lib/servers.xml file to the 
jrun/lib directory.

The servers.xml file is setup so that it points to this directory in OFBiz
for the ofbiz server configuration, so you don't have to copy the 
ofbiz/setup/jrun4/servers/ofbiz directory to jrun/servers.

Once this is done you just need to setup your database in the 
ofbiz/setup/jrun4/servers/ofbiz/SERVER-INF/jrun-resources.xml file. You
may also want to adjust other settings in files in that directory.

To run just use the jrun server start/stop application or the command line
with java -jar.

Good luck!
