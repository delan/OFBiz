This is the sample OFBiz configuration for Jetty from Mort Bay Consulting. 

Jetty is an open source JSP/Servlet container very similar to Tomcat. This
configuration if for Jetty version 4, since that is the first version 
supporting Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2.

To run Jetty simply get the current Jetty 4 distro, put it in a directory
that is a sibling of the OFBIZ_HOME directory. You can put it in a 
different directory, but then you will have to set the OFBIZ_HOME env
variable. Copy the files from the setup directory the jetty directory
in their respective paths (bin/ofbiz.sh and etc/ofbiz.xml).

With the files in place just go into the jetty/bin directory and run
"ofbiz.sh start". To stop Jetty just run "ofbiz.sh stop".

It's really pretty simple.

Hope that helps.
