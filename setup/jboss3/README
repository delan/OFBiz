These config files and startup scripts are tested on JBoss RC3, but will
likely work on newer versions depending on how much changes in JBoss.

JBoss with embedded Tomcat must be placed in the same directory as the 
OFBiz root directory. In other words a certain directory must have the 
jboss and ofbiz directories under it.

To install all related files, edit $OFBIZ_HOME/build.properties and change the 
values as followed:

ofbiz.home=<your_ofbiz_home_directory>
server=jboss3
server.home=<your_jboss3_home_directory>

Now execute ant:

ant -f xbuild.xml install - to install required files
ant -f xbuild.xml build - to compile and archive all required files, jars
ant -f xbuild.xml deploy  - to deploy all required files and jars.

Make sure the entityengine.xml file in jboss/server/ofbiz/conf is configured
as you want it, that is where this configuration will look for it. Make sure
it is getting the JTA UserTransaction object and the JDBC connection from JNDI.
(Default values already set).

By default the entity engine will use the data source mapped to java:/DefaultDS so a 
default installation of JBoss 3 should work "out of the box" without any additional
configuration required.

If you do want to change the data source, follow these directions:


Adjust the datasource-name value for your database setup in entityengine.xml:

<!-- Adjust the datasource-name to your database setup: This example makes use of Postgres72 -->  
  <delegator name="default" entity-model-reader="main" entity-group-reader="main">
    <group-map group-name="org.ofbiz.commonapp" datasource-name="localpostgres72"/>
</delegator>


Next copy the database service definition for your database from jboss/docs/examples/jca
to the jboss/server/ofbiz/deploy directory.
Adjust the required parameters in the <your_database>-service.xml.
Be aware, that this example configuration assumes, that your Datasource JNDI name is 
DefaultDS. Therefore change the following parameter to DefaultDS in XXX-service.xml:

  <attribute name="JndiName">DefaultDS</attribute>

In each XXX-service.xml a brief example is given, which values have to be added into 
jboss/server/ofbiz/conf/login-config.xml. Follow the instructions there.
 
Next edit jboss/server/ofbiz/conf/standardjaws.xml and set your values for datasource
and type-mapping:

Example for PostgreSQL:

<jaws>
   <datasource>java:/DefaultDS</datasource>
   <type-mapping>PostgreSQL</type-mapping>
...

Next edit jboss/server/ofbiz/conf/standardjbosscmp-jdbc.xml and set your values for 
datasource and datasource-mapping:

Example for PostgreSQL:

<jbosscmp-jdbc>
   
   <defaults>
      <datasource>java:/DefaultDS</datasource>
      <datasource-mapping>PostgreSQL</datasource-mapping>
...

Copy your jdbc driver jar to the jboss/server/ofbiz/deploy directory.

Go into jboss/bin and run the ofbiz.sh script. It uses the ofbiz config that
you just created.

This JBoss configuration uses Tomcat or Jetty for the front end. 

JBoss is used by OFBiz instead of Tyrex for JTA and XA JDBC connection pooling.
This enables OFBiz and the Entity Engine to be used in the same context as EJBs
and other resources deployed inside JBoss. It also allows for future expansion
with JMS and the many other services that JBoss provides. Actually you can use
Tyrex as the transaction manager for JBoss, but in that case you will still be
using it through JBoss to make sure you use the SAME transaction manager that
JBoss is using. So, this config gets the JDBC connection and JTA UserTransaction
objects from JBoss.
