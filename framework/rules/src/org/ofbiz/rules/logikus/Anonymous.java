 * <p>An anonymous variable unifies successfully with any other
 * term, without binding to the term.
 * <p>
 * Anonymous variables are useful for screening out unwanted
 * terms. For example, if a program describes a marriage in
 * terms of an id, the husband, wife, and the beginning and
 * end dates of the marriage, its facts might look something
 * like:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     marriage(001, balthasar, grimelda, 14560512, 14880711);
 *     // ...
 *     marriage(257, kevin, karla, 19790623, present);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * A rule that extracts just the husband from
 * <code>marriage</code> facts is:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     husband(Id, Hub) :- marriage(Id, Hub, _, _, _);
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * The underscores in this rule represent anonymous variables.
 * When the rule executes, it will unify its
 * <code>marriage</code> structure with <code>marriage</code>
 * facts, without regard to the last three terms of those
 * facts.
 * <p>
 * Without anonymous variables, the <code>husband</code> rule
 * would need three unused variables. Note that the following
 * approach would fail:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     husband(Id, Hub) :-
 *         marriage(Id, Hub, Anon, Anon, Anon); // wrong
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * This approach, while tempting, will not work because the
 * variable <code>Anon</code> will bind to the structures it
 * encounters. Issued against the example program,
 * <code>Anon</code> will first bind to <code>grimelda</code>.
 * Next, <code>Anon</code> will attempt to bind to
 * <code>14560512</code>. This will fail, since
 * <code>Anon</code> will already be bound to
 * <code>grimelda</code>.
 * <p>
 * The essential behavior anonymous variables provide is that
 * they unify successfully without binding.
